Abstract = {In this study, the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics of
   multirotor electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft in hovering
   and forward flight are compared using two representative control
   methods: fixed-pitch control and variable-pitch control (i.e.,
   revolution per minute (RPM) control and collective pitch control). To
   this end, a comprehensive multirotor noise assessment framework is used
   to predict the aerodynamics and noise of multirotors controlled by RPM
   and collective pitch. High-resolution time-frequency analysis is used to
   clarify the differences in noise spectral characteristics. The findings
   indicate that blade passage frequency characteristics vary significantly
   depending on the control method. The phase differences between the
   rotors of variable-pitch control remain constant irrespective of
   disturbances or attitude control. In other words, the frequencies of the
   tone noise do not exhibit short-periodic modulation, unlike those of
   RPM-controlled multirotor. Additionally, the aeroacoustic
   characteristics of fixed-pitch and variable-pitch controlled multirotor
   in response to wind velocity fluctuation are investigated by considering
   the direction of noise radiation and interference effects. The impact of
   the turbulent kinetic energy of wind on the noise characteristics is
   examined by quantifying the noise components associated with aerodynamic
   unsteadiness in flight. Furthermore, the rotor phase control method can
   be applied to reduce noise in both control methods. The optimization of
   rotor phases reduces tone noise significantly at the target observer
   point without causing aerodynamic losses in variable-pitch controlled
   multirotor. In contrast, the reduction in tone noise remains relatively
   limited for fixed-pitch controlled multirotor, as the rotor phase
   differences are not maintained.},

Title = {Noise from Unconventional Aircraft: A Review of Current Measurement

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewThis review aims to evaluate and discuss the current
   advances in the measurement and assessment of the noise generated by
   unconventional aircraft, such as unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and
   urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles. Building upon the findings of this
   review, research gaps are identified, and further work is proposed to
   enhance existing and emerging methods for the appropriate noise
   management of these advanced air mobility (AAM) technologies.Recent
   FindingsNoise has been highlighted as one of the key concerns for the
   wider deployment of UAS and UAM operations. This is suggested to be due
   to having acoustic signatures with sound characteristics commonly
   associated with noise annoyance, such as `sharpness' (the perceived
   proportion of high-pitched sonic energy) and `tonality' (the perceptual
   prominence of concentrated sonic energy at discrete frequencies). These
   types of `psychoacoustic features' are thought to be connected with
   observations of increased noise annoyance for AAM, compared with
   conventional aircraft and road vehicles, at the same level of sound
   exposure.SummaryIn the last few years, there has been a growing body of
   research on UAS and UAM noise. Research has focused on a comprehensive
   understanding of the sound sources of these unconventional aircraft
   under a wide range of operating and operational conditions. Based on
   gathered evidence, measurement protocols for both laboratory and field
   studies are very advanced for the acoustic characterisation of UAS in
   terms of sound level, frequency and directivity. Looking at the human
   response to UAS and UAM noise, loudness has been consistently reported
   as the main contributor to noise annoyance, with second-order
   contributions from other psychoacoustic features, such as sharpness,
   tonality and `amplitude modulation' (fluctuations in loudness over
   time), varying among studies. Noise targets for UAS certification have
   been derived from existing regulations for conventional aircraft and
   rotorcraft, but might not account for the usually reported annoyance
   offset between UAS/UAM and conventional vehicles. Key research gaps
   identified include the lack of studies focusing on multiple events, and
   deeper understanding of the influence that personal or contextual
   factors may have on responses, which will be important for the
   development of robust methods for the assessment and minimisation of
   community noise annoyance due to the operation of these unconventional
   aircraft.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of blade skew on the interaction
   tones produced by a contrarotating unmanned aerial vehicle rotor system
   using computational, analytical, and experimental methods. Computational
   fluid dynamics simulations are used to predict the periodic unsteady
   loading on the blades of three sets of rotors with different amounts of
   skew. This loading data is used to predict the acoustic pressure
   time-history and the sound pressure levels of the interaction tones
   radiated from the rotor systems. The predictions are compared with
   experimental measurements and show good agreement. It is observed that
   the amplitude of prominent interaction tones decreases as the blade skew
   angle increases and that the overall A-weighted sound power level of the
   interaction tones radiated from the rotor systems decreases
   significantly as skew angle increases. It is shown that this reduction
   in noise level is in-part caused by the dephasing of the acoustic
   pressure emitted from different radii along the blades of the rotor
   systems.},

Title = {Towards sustainable UAV operations: Balancing economic optimization with
   environmental and social considerations in path planning},
Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {181},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), i.e., drones, are expected to be widely
   used in various applications, such as parcel delivery and passenger
   transport, with the benefits of mitigating traffic congestion and
   reducing carbon emissions. In this paper, we study a UAV path planning
   problem under uncertain weather conditions, and design a data-driven
   dynamic decision support system for multiple types of UAVs. To this end,
   we categorize all relevant costs into three types, namely, economic,
   environmental, and social costs, and formulate a nonlinear two-stage
   stochastic programming model to establish optimal paths for UAV missions
   under weather uncertainty. We then discretize the nonlinear model and
   propose a tight linear approximation for the discretized problem to
   allow for a near real-time implementation. To quantify weather
   uncertainty, we propose a weather scenario generation algorithm to map
   ensemble-based weather forecast information to airspace blockage maps.
   With comprehensive computational studies through simulations, we show
   that our proposed stochastic approach can lower operating costs by an
   average of around 6\%, where the savings increase as weather conditions
   become more severe and complex. We also find that, for missions operated
   by small UAVs, it is not sufficient to determine a path solely based on
   economic cost minimization, but it should rather be through total cost
   minimization, which involves environmental and social costs. Considering
   only the economic cost in the optimization may lead to much higher
   non-economic costs. However, for missions operated by large UAVs, it is
   sufficient to determine paths through economic cost optimization, as
   including environmental and social costs in the optimization process
   does not result in solutions that are much different from those obtained
   by considering only the economic costs. For both small and large UAVs, a
   path established solely through environmental or social cost
   minimization may not be economically sustainable, as doing so would
   imply very high economic costs.},

Title = {Flow confinement effects on sUAS rotor noise},
Journal = {AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of flow confinement
   on the noise generated by a small unmanned aerial system rotor measured
   and simulated in a partially closed test room. More specifically, the
   influence of the flow recirculation in the test room and the consequent
   blade turbulence interaction on both the tonal unsteady loading noise
   and the broadband laminar separation noise components are scrutinized.
   The study also aims at improving our prediction capabilities of drone
   rotor noise, and deepening our fundamental knowledge of rotor
   aeroacoustics in transitional boundary layer regimes. Numerical
   simulations are conducted by means of a scale-resolving wall-modelled
   lattice Boltzmann solver to calculate the unsteady flow and the noise
   generated by the same reference configuration used in our previous
   works, which consists in a rotor operated at a chord-based Reynolds
   number of about 70000 at 75\% of the tip radius, both in hover and axial
   flow conditions. Results for a rotor in pristine flow conditions are
   compared to results obtained by simulating the rotor in a confined
   environment that reproduces the A-Tunnel test chamber of Delft
   University of Technology. On one hand, our study reveals that previously
   observed discrepancies between measured and predicted noise spectra in
   hover conditions are not due to the influence of the flow confinement on
   the laminar separation mechanisms, as hypothesized in our previous
   study, rather to a lack of numerical resolution. On the other hand, the
   new results reveal that, in hover conditions, the dominant effect of the
   flow recirculation is to increase the unsteady loading tonal noise
   components, whereas, in axial flow conditions, no significant effect due
   to the test environment is observed. Some of our conclusive observations
   are supported by results obtained using a source identification
   technique herein presented for the first time.},

Title = {Drone audition for bioacoustic monitoring},

Abstract = {Multi-rotor drones equipped with acoustic sensors have great potential
   for bioacoustically monitoring vocal species in the environment for
   biodiversity conservation. The bottleneck of this emerging technology is
   the ego-noise from the rotating motors and propellers, which can
   completely mask the target sound and make sound recordings unusable for
   further analysis. The ego-noise not only degrades the performance of
   bioacoustic monitoring but also impacts the behaviour of target species
   if the drone is too close to the target area. In this paper, we address
   this challenging problem by combining hardware and software solutions
   that minimize the impact of drone ego-noise on bioacoustic monitoring.To
   collect the target sound from the ground, we used a shotgun microphone
   recording system suspended underneath the drone body with a wire rope
   (steel fishing line) of length 2 m. The suspended rope puts a large
   distance between the drone and the recorder, reducing the propeller
   sound perceived by the microphone. The shotgun microphone enables the
   sound to be picked up from the ground effectively while rejecting the
   drone sound from above. We further developed a software solution that
   aims to automatically recognize the bird species from the bird call
   recording and we proposed a noise-augmented training scheme to improve
   the robustness of bird recognition in the presence of strong drone
   noise.We evaluated the performance of the system in a test problem of
   recognizing 20 bird species with in-flight recordings, where a
   loudspeaker on the ground simulates bird calls. The recordings were
   obtained using a drone hovering at various altitudes ranging from 5 to
   30 m. By combining the hardware and software solutions, the system
   recognizes birds robustly at an altitude of 30 m and signal-to-noise
   ratio -25 dB.This demonstrates the feasibility of our drone audition
   system for bioacoustic monitoring. The proposed method overcomes a
   long-standing bottleneck problem in drone audition and promises new
   applications of bioacoustic monitoring in research and management.},

Title = {On-field noise measurements and acoustic characterisation of multi-rotor
   small unmanned aerial systems},
Journal = {AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The noise signature of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) is highly
   influenced by specific operating and weather conditions. Accurate noise
   assessment of sUAS operations requires field noise measurements that
   capture all the complexity of sound emission and propagation during
   realistic flight situations. This paper presents a measurement and
   analysis framework for the acoustic characterisation of sUAS through the
   calculation of conventional noise metrics (LAmax and LAE), frequency and
   directivity features. Using a multi-channel measurement approach, and
   back-propagating the sound from ground microphone to source, the
   presented framework allows the calculation of acoustic hemispheres for a
   selection of acoustic metrics. Important findings are that (i) the
   framework is robust for a variety of multi-rotor sUAS varying in size
   and configuration; (ii) broadband noise and tonal noise are the dominant
   noise sources during flyover for larger sUAS and smaller sUAS
   respectively; (iii) the maximum noise radiation of the sUAS tested is
   found in the rear arc of polar directivity; and (iv) angles of maximum
   radiation of amplitude modulated noise have been found for most sUAS
   tested at 0 angles \& PLUSMN;30 degrees. This work is intended to be
   relevant in establishing common protocols regarding sUAS acoustic
   certification between environmental policymakers, stakeholders, and
   industry.\& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Title = {Experimental and numerical investigation of the sound field produced by
   a shrouded UAV propeller},
Journal = {APPLIED ACOUSTICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {211},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of an acoustically rigid shroud on
   the tonal noise produced by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) propeller.
   Enclosing the propeller with a shroud alters the steady loading on the
   propeller blades, thereby changing the steady loading tones radiated
   from the sources on the propeller surface. In this paper it is shown
   that the time-average rotating pressure field on the inner surface of
   the shroud also makes a significant contribution to the tonal noise. The
   aerodynamics of a shrouded and an isolated propeller was investigated
   using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The tones produced
   by the steady loading and thickness sources on the propeller, and the
   time-average rotating pressure field on the surface of the shroud were
   calculated using an acoustic analogy approach and data from the CFD
   simulations. These calculations show that the tonal noise radiated from
   the loading sources on the inner surface of the shroud make a
   significant contribution to the tonal noise levels and that the
   contribution from the loading sources on the other surfaces of the
   shroud are negligible. A probe microphone was used to measure the
   time-average rotating pressure field on the inner surface of the shroud
   and these measurements showed good agreement with the CFD simulation.
   These measurements were then used to calculate the contribution of the
   loading sources on the inner surface of the shroud to the total noise
   measured experimentally. High resolution acoustic measurements in the
   near-field of a shrouded and an isolated propeller were also taken. The
   near-field measurements were then projected to the acoustic far-field
   and these levels are compared with numerical predictions. The results
   show that the effect of the shroud is to decrease the tonal noise for
   observers below the rotational plane of the propeller. \& COPY; 2023 The

Abstract = {The noise produced by the propellers of micro Unmanned Air Vehicles
   (UAVs) could be counterproductive to their mission, since adversaries
   can often hear them from a distance. This study investigates new quiet
   propeller designs that have different twist angle distributions that
   vary the lift generated along the span of the propeller blade to reduce
   the thrust loading near the tip. In addition, nine co-rotating dual
   propellers with different phase angle and spacing are considered. All
   propellers were tested at the USAFA subsonic wind tunnel at an assumed
   UAV cruise velocity of 44 ft/s while measuring thrust, torque, sound
   pressure level, and rotational speed over a range of power settings.
   These propellers are modeled using the DoD HPCMP CREATETM-AV Kestrel
   simulation tools. The thrust and torque were extracted from these
   simulations and compared with experimental data. Pressure tap points
   were defined one inch behind the propeller. The instantaneous pressure
   data were measured at these locations for 20 spinning cycles. Sound
   pressure level values were then estimated from these data. Predictions
   are then compared with experimental data measured from a traversing
   microphone.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Noise Impact Assessment of UAS Operation in Urbanised Areas: Field
   Measurements and a Simulation},
Journal = {DRONES},

Abstract = {This article's main topic is an assessment of unmanned aircraft system
   (UAS) noise pollution in several weight categories according to
   Regulation (EU) 2019/947 and its impact on the urban environment during
   regular operation. The necessity of solving the given problem is caused
   by an increasing occurrence of UASs in airspace and the prospect of
   introducing unmanned aircraft into broader commercial operations. This
   work aims to provide an overview of noise measurements of two UAS weight
   categories under natural atmospheric conditions to assess their impact
   on the surrounding environment. On top of that, modelling and
   simulations were used to observe and assess the noise emission
   characteristics. The quantitative results contain an assessment of the
   given noise restrictions based on the psychoacoustic impact and actual
   measured values inserted into the urban simulation scenario of the
   Zilina case study located in northwest Slovakia. It was preceded by a
   study of noise levels in certain areas to evaluate the variation level
   after UAS integration into the corresponding airspace. Following a model
   simulation of the C2 category, it was concluded that there was a
   marginal rise in the level of noise exposure, which would not exceed the
   prescribed standards of the Environmental Noise Directive.},

Title = {Investigation of the Interaction Tones Produced by Contra-Rotating
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Rotor Systems},
Journal = {AIAA JOURNAL},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the interaction tones produced by the periodic
   unsteady loading on the blades of two different contra-rotating unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) rotor systems using computational, analytical, and
   experimental methods. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are
   used to predict the unsteady loading on the rotor blades and to
   visualize the flow through the rotors. Semi-analytical models are also
   presented for predicting the portion of this unsteady loading due to the
   interaction of each blade with the bound potential field of the adjacent
   rotor. A comparison of the unsteady loading predicted using the CFD
   simulations and the semi-analytical models shows that, for the cases
   considered, the semi-analytical models accurately predict the unsteady
   loading on the top rotor and that the bound potential field interaction
   source is a significant contributor to the total unsteady loading on the
   bottom rotor. A frequency-domain acoustic analogy method is also
   presented, which is used to calculate the interaction tones produced by
   the unsteady loading on the rotor blades at various observer locations.
   Predictions of the sound pressure levels of the prominent interaction
   tones at different observer locations are presented and compared with
   experimental measurements showing generally good agreement. The effect
   of rotor spacing on the amplitude of the interaction tones is also
   explored, and it is shown that the methods predict a decrease in sound
   pressure level produced by increasing the rotor spacing and that these
   predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements.},

Journal = {TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {118},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this work, the noise impact of delivery drones in an urban community
   is assessed based on a flight simulation and noise assessment platform.
   The tonal and broadband noise components are considered using analytical
   and semi-analytical prediction methods. The noise propagation in the
   urban environment is computed using an efficient Gaussian beam tracing
   method. The influence of flight speeds, payloads and ground vegetation
   on noise reception at different observation locations are investigated.
   The instantaneous sound level can be higher if the drone is operated at
   a relatively higher speed. However, the overall sound exposure might be
   lower because of the shorter flight time. Similarly, the drone with a
   heavier payload could be louder, but in the meanwhile, fewer flight
   times are required. The platform provides an economical approach to
   understanding the effect of those competing influential factors, which
   are essential for the following low-noise flight path planning.},

Title = {Practical Study of Recurrent Neural Networks for Efficient Real-Time
   Drone Sound Detection: A Review},

Abstract = {The detection and classification of engine-based moving objects in
   restricted scenes from acoustic signals allow better Unmanned Aerial
   System (UAS)-specific intelligent systems and audio-based surveillance
   systems. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) provide wide coverage in the
   field of acoustic analysis due to their effectiveness in widespread
   practical applications. In this work, we propose to study SimpleRNN,
   LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU recurrent network models for real-time UAV sound
   recognition systems based on Mel-spectrogram using Kapre layers. The
   main goal of the work is to study the types of RNN networks in a
   practical sense for a reliable drone sound recognition system. According
   to the results of an experimental study, the GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)
   network model demonstrated a higher prediction ability than other RNN
   architectures for detecting differences and the state of objects from
   acoustic signals. That is, RNNs gave higher recognition than CNNs for
   loaded and unloaded audio states of various UAV models, while the GRU
   model showed about 98\% accuracy for determining the UAV load states and
   99\% accuracy for background noise, which consisted of more other data.},

Abstract = {There is a growing interest for commercial applications of Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicles, but important foundations for an assessment, among
   others about noise, are missing. This contribution specifically focuses
   on a method to measure and model the sound radiation of multicopters.
   The emission prediction is hereby based on measurements using a multiple
   regression approach. An important finding is that the directivity
   pattern is widely independent of the rotational speed of the rotors and
   of the flight procedure. Consequently, the directivity pattern can be
   determined for a stationary hover flight, which considerably simplifies
   the measurement procedure. In addition to a rotational speed-dependent
   sound emission model for hover flight, a multicopter-specific correction
   term is required to account for forward flight. The validity of this
   approach is demonstrated based on the field measurements of three
   different multicopter models.},

Abstract = {A noise covariance matrix (NCM) estimation method for unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) audition is proposed with rotor noise reduction as its
   primary focus. The proposed NCM estimation method could be incorporated
   into audio processing algorithms using UAV-mounted microphone array
   systems. The NCM is formed through accurate estimation of the microphone
   array input signal's amplitude and phase by using a multi-sensory rotor
   noise power spectral density (PSD) estimator and a filter formed by
   exploiting the acoustical relationship between the microphone array and
   the rotor noise sources, respectively. The estimated NCM aims to be
   readily incorporable into several source enhancement algorithms to
   reduce the effects of rotor noise and improve the resultant audio
   quality. Experiment evaluation using real in-flight UAV rotor noise
   recordings shows that the estimated NCM significantly improves rotor
   noise reduction (of up to \$\textbackslash{}sim 28\$ dB) and the quality
   of the target sound.},

Title = {On the prediction of noise generated by urban air mobility (UAM)
   vehicles. Part II. Implementation of the Farassat F1A formulation into a
   modern surface-vorticity panel solver},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the integration of established acoustic prediction
   techniques directly into a surface-vorticity solver. The main objective
   is to enhance an aircraft designer's ability to characterize the
   acoustic signatures generated by urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, in
   general, and distributed electric propulsion (DEP) concepts, in
   particular, including unmanned aerial vehicles. Our solver consists of a
   reliable, surface-vorticity panel code that incorporates viscous
   boundary-layer corrections. Thus, it offers a computationally efficient
   commercial tool for conceptual design and preliminary aerodynamic
   analysis. By implementing the Farassat F1A acoustics formulation
   directly into the solver, a new intuitive capability is achieved, which
   is both conversive with modern engineering tools and efficient in setup
   and speed of execution. In addition to its application to the X-57
   high-lift propeller and the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology
   Tiltwing electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle by the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this capability is
   systematically demonstrated using three particular case studies. These
   consist of both single- and six-propeller Joby S4 eVTOL as well as a
   small eight-propeller Kittyhawk KH-H1 DEP vehicle. Although the details
   of this tool and underlying equations are showcased in this article, the
   acoustic metrics that can be effectively used to characterize the noise
   level generated by a UAM in flight are described in a companion article.
   By embedding this assortment of insightful metrics into a simple and
   user-friendly flow solver, a much improved flow-acoustic analysis
   capability is thereby provided to support the design of future aircraft.

Abstract = {This paper proposes an experimental setup for measuring the sound
   radiation of a quadrotor drone using a hemispherical microphone array.
   The measured sound field is decomposed into spherical harmonics, which
   enables the evaluation of the radiation pattern to non-probed positions.
   Additionally, the measurement setup allows the assessment of noise
   emission and psychoacoustic metrics at a wide range of angles. The
   obtained directivity patterns using a third-order spherical harmonic
   decomposition (SHD) are shown to exhibit low distortion with respect to
   the original measurements, therefore, validating the SHD as an adequate
   representation strategy. Furthermore, the noise emissions are evaluated,
   and the highest noise emission is observed in the 90 \& DEG; azimuth
   direction. The exterior spherical acoustic holography description is
   employed to evaluate psychoacoustic metrics at arbitrary far-field
   positions and validated on a reference microphone. The estimated
   psychoacoustic metrics are closely related to the target metrics, which
   allows for sound quality analysis at any point external to the drone.

Journal = {AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of
   the Lattice-Boltzmann/Very-Large-Eddy-Simulation CFD solver SIMULIA
   PowerFLOW (R) when a transitional flow past a small drone rotor blade is
   simulated, without using any numerical or physical turbulence triggering
   system. A recently developed variant of PowerFLOW VLES model is
   validated against measurements performed at Delft University of
   Technology. A 2-bladed propeller of 0.3 m diameter is considered, which
   is operated at 4000 and 5000 RPM and two different advance ratios, 0.0
   and 0.6, for each angular velocity. In such conditions, corresponding to
   a Reynolds number based on the chord at 75\% of the tip radius ranging
   between 7 middot 104 and 9 middot 104, the presence of a laminar
   separation bubble was experimentally observed and related to the
   occurrence of a high-frequency broadband noise hump in the far-field
   noise spectra. The numerical results are in a good agreement with the
   loading, noise and PIV experimental measurements, demonstrating the
   capability of the new PowerFLOW VLES model to predict boundary layer
   flow transitional phenomena such as laminar separation, reattachment and
   transition to turbulence, as well as the corresponding broadband
   trailing-edge noise radiation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {Drone-monitoring radars typically integrate many pulses in order to
   improve signal to noise ratio and enable high detection performance.
   Over the course of this coherent processing interval (CPI), many
   components of the drone signature change and the signature's amplitude
   and Doppler modulations may hinder coherent integration performance,
   even in the absence of range-Doppler cell migrations. A statistical
   characterisation of these fluctuations aides radar designers in
   selecting optimal CPI lengths. This paper presents a statistical
   analysis of experimental data of nine flying drones, collected with a
   frequency modulated continuous wave Ku-band radar, and examines the
   statistical features of the amplitude fluctuations of the drone body and
   blades as well as the signature decorrelation time. The method of
   moments is used to estimate the probability density function parameters
   of different drone spectral components with the aim of informing the
   development of improved theory for predicting drone signatures and
   ultimately increasing detection performance. Results show that, on
   average, the Weibull distribution provided the best mean square error
   fit to the data for most drone spectral components and drone types, with
   the Rayleigh distribution being the next best match. These results were
   further corroborated by a study of detection performance for a
   fluctuating target. Whilst decorrelation times of the various signatures
   varied significantly, even for the same drone, results show that an
   approximate inverse relationship between drone spectral component
   bandwidth and decorrelation time held, with individual spectral lines
   decorrelating after tens to hundreds of msec.},

Abstract = {The recent explosion in interest into the use of UAVs for a wide range
   of commercial applications has also raised awareness of the issue of
   noise coming from UAVs. This paper introduces a method for predicting
   the aeroacoustic noise of a flexible UAV propeller while considering
   bending-torsion coupling. Numerical simulations of a flexible UAV
   propeller are conducted under hovering conditions to investigate the
   coupling effect on noise prediction using a fluid-structure interaction
   and acoustic model based on Formulation 1A of Farassat. The
   bending-torsion coupling leads to additional bending-induced torsional
   deformation along with considerable increases in noise and the overall
   sound pressure level. The results indicate that the noise evaluated
   without the coupling was underestimated compared to that evaluated with
   the coupling. Finally, the bending-torsion coupling is shown to be
   essential for precisely predicting the noise of a rotating flexible UAV
   propeller to respond to strengthening noise regulations.},

Title = {Requirements for Drone Operations to Minimise Community Noise Impact},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The number of applications for drones under R\&D have growth
   significantly during the last few years; however, the wider adoption of
   these technologies requires ensuring public trust and acceptance. Noise
   has been identified as one of the key concerns for public acceptance.
   Although substantial research has been carried out to better understand
   the sound source generation mechanisms in drones, important questions
   remain about the requirements for operational procedures and regulatory
   frameworks. An important issue is that drones operate within different
   airspace, closer to communities than conventional aircraft, and that the
   noise produced is highly tonal and contains a greater proportion of
   high-frequency broadband noise compared with typical aircraft noise.
   This is likely to cause concern for exposed communities due to impacts
   on public health and well-being. This paper presents a modelling
   framework for setting recommendations for drone operations to minimise
   community noise impact. The modelling framework is based on specific
   noise targets, e.g., the guidelines at a receiver position defined by
   WHO for sleep quality inside a residential property. The main assumption
   is that the estimation of drone noise exposure indoors is highly
   relevant for informing operational constraints to minimise noise
   annoyance and sleep disturbance. This paper illustrates the
   applicability of the modelling framework with a case study, where
   maximum A-weighted sound pressure levels LAmax and sound exposure levels
   SEL as received in typical indoor environments are used to define
   drone-facade minimum distance to meet WHO recommendations. The practical
   and scalable capabilities of this modelling framework make it a useful
   tool for inferring and assessing the impact of drone noise through
   compliance with appropriate guideline noise criteria. It is considered
   that with further refinement, this modelling framework could prove to be
   a significant tool in assisting with the development of noise metrics,
   regulations specific to drone operations and the assessment of future
   drone operations and associated noise.},

Title = {Evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicles for surveys of lek-mating grouse},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are being utilized by
   wildlife biologists to monitor populations of birds and mammals.
   However, the reaction of wildlife to drones varies by species, so a
   preliminary evaluation must be conducted to determine if the target
   species can be detected via drone footage and to determine how the
   target species will react to drone presence. Lek-mating prairie-chickens
   (Tympanuchus spp.) seem amenable to drone-based surveys because they are
   relatively large and display in groups on elevated sites with sparse
   vegetation. The goal of our study was to determine what flight
   characteristics maximize prairie-chicken detection on drone video
   footage, to document the birds' reactions to the drones, and to compare
   how the noise produced by the drones compares to ambient sounds. We
   tested 3 sizes of rotary-winged drones, flown at 3 heights, with 3
   different camera angles by flying over known prairie-chicken leks. We
   determined that >65\% of prairie-chickens present were detected using
   video footage at a height of 100 m with a 10 degrees camera angle.
   Drones of different sizes had similar detectability. However, observers
   in blinds adjacent to leks routinely detected more birds than were
   detected on drone footage (detection on drone footage was 39.7 +/- 9.6\%
   of birds present). Prairie-chickens flushed in 96\% of trials when a
   drone was flown over display locations. Time to return to the lek
   following drone disturbance was similar to prairie-chickens' reactions
   to natural predators. Prairie-chickens flushed when drone sound levels
   were comparable to ambient noise. Developing guidelines for the ethical
   use of drones in wildlife research will require quantifying the amount
   of taxa-specific disturbance caused by drones. Our study begins to close
   this knowledge gap by documenting disturbance to upland, lek-mating
   grouse of conservation concern, and suggests that the focal species'
   reaction to aerial predators may provide clues as to how that species
   may react to drones.},

Abstract = {This work presents a high-efficiency low-noise propeller design for
   unmanned aerial vehicles. Three different blade configurations are first
   investigated, using the computational aeroacoustic approach to recognize
   the flow around propellers and the noise emissions. The flow simulation
   is obtained by an acoustic-wave preserved artificial compressibility
   method, and the far-field noise is extrapolated by solving the
   Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equations. Experiments are also conducted
   to validate numerical simulations and the design philosophy. The
   comparison between numerical and experimental results confirms an
   encouraging agreement regarding aerodynamic efficiency, noise spectra
   and differences between propellers. The results show that two designed
   propellers can simultaneously improve aerodynamic efficiency and reduce
   noise emissions compared to the baseline propeller. It is observed that
   using a longer chord length and shorter propeller radius can reduce flow
   separation at the trailing edge. Furthermore, a qualitative noise-source
   analysis shows that broadband noise sources are primarily ascribed to
   the time-derivative of blade surface pressure and occur at the trailing
   edge near the tip. Published under an exclusive license by AIP

Abstract = {In the present work a dynamic simulation model for a quadcopter drone is
   developed and validated through experimental flight data. The
   aerodynamics of the rotors is modeled with the blade element theory
   combined with the Peters and He dynamic wake model, using an appropriate
   number of states. The aerodynamic forces and moments thus calculated
   feed the dynamic equations of a drone and an aeroacoustics model, to
   obtain an estimate of the noise generated during the flight. Loading and
   thickness noise are calculated as a time domain solution of the wave
   equation (Farassat 1A formulation), with mobile sources in stagnant
   flow. The results of numerical simulations are compared with
   experimental data recorded during flights performed at the Aerospace
   Italian Research Center (CIRA), both for the flight dynamics and the
   aeroacoustics models. To customize the model to the drone used, a laser
   scanner is used to obtain the geometric characteristics of the blades
   and the XFOIL program is used to calculate the blade profile aerodynamic
   coefficients.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly advancing and becoming ubiquitous
   in an unlimited number of applications, from parcel delivery to people
   transportation. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) markets expand, the
   increased acoustic nuisance on population becomes a more acute problem.
   Previous aircraft noise assessments have highlighted the necessity of a
   psychoacoustic metric for quantification of human audio perception. This
   study presents a framework for estimating propeller-based UAV auditory
   detection probability on the ground for a listener in a real-life
   scenario. The detection probability is derived by using its free-field
   measured acoustic background and estimating the UAV threshold according
   to a physiological model of the auditory pathway. The method is
   presented via results of an exemplar measurement in an anechoic
   environment with a single two- and five-bladed propeller. It was found
   that the auditory detection probability is primarily affected by the
   background noise level, whereas the number of blades is a less
   significant parameter. The significance of the proposed method lies in
   providing a quantitative evaluation of auditory detection probability of
   the UAV on the ground in the presence of a given soundscape. The results
   of this work are of practical significance since the method can aid
   anyone who plans a hovering flight mode. (C) 2022 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {Noise source features of multi-propeller systems are experimentally
   studied in this paper. Noise sources on a pair of side-by-side placed
   small-scale propellers and a flying quad-copter are investigated
   separately using microphone arrays and the conventional beamforming
   algorithm. A high-intensity noise source spot is identified within the
   gap area between two propeller disks, which is a result of the
   interaction between the blade tip and upwash flow within the gap area.
   As the two propellers move away from each other, the noise source spot
   becomes weaker. Similarly, for a quad-copter under realistic flight
   conditions, the strongest noise sources are observed within the gap
   between each of two adjacent propellers, showing the feasibility and
   repeatability of the result obtained in the lab. The results discussed
   in this paper show that for the low-noise design of a multi-propeller
   drone, not only is the single propeller noise, but also the propeller
   interactional noise shall be taken into account. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Propeller-strut interaction tone noise},
Journal = {PHYSICS OF FLUIDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper presents a detailed investigation of tonal noise produced by
   an unmanned aerial vehicle propeller operating with a circular strut
   mounted just downstream. Experimental measurements of the acoustic
   pressure in near- and far-fields are presented, and it is observed that
   the measured pressure signals contain a strong impulse caused by the
   propeller-strut interaction. The magnitude and shape of this impulse
   vary significantly with an observer location. It was also observed that
   the magnitude of these impulses was reduced by increasing the distance
   between the propeller and the strut. In order to investigate the physics
   of the noise generation mechanism, a number of computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed, and a numerical method was
   developed to predict the radiated acoustic tones using the CFD data.
   This analysis showed that the unsteady loading sources on the strut and
   the propeller both made significant contributions to the total impulse,
   and the directivity of the sound radiated from the strut was different
   from that radiated from the propeller. Therefore, the addition of the
   signals from the propeller and the strut produced a pressure impulse,
   which had a complex directivity. Analytical models were also developed
   to estimate the unsteady loading on the propeller and strut from which
   estimates of the radiated noise field could be made. Predictions made
   using these models are compared with CFD predictions and experimental
   measurements of the unsteady loading on the strut and also the total
   radiated noise field and show reasonable agreement. Published under an

Abstract = {Drones and urban air mobility vehicles, which are mostly intended for
   urban operations, have attracted intensive research interest. Their
   environmental noise impact should not be ignored and should be a
   certification consideration. Numerical simulations can provide means to
   efficiently assess the noise impact on the complex urban environments,
   thanks to the advances in both software and hardware. In this study,
   virtual flights of the noise sources to mimic the drones and urban air
   mobilities are conducted to investigate the environmental impact by
   using the Gaussian beam tracing method implemented in an in-house solver
   Environmental Acoustic Ray Tracing Code, in which the dominant acoustic
   processes in outdoor applications are modelled. The solver also allows
   for modelling of sources with generic directivity patterns, which is
   beneficial for investigating the drone and urban air mobility noise
   produced by multiple rotors. Two examples of studying noise impact on
   building and realistic urban environment are conducted. The effects of
   the surface acoustic impedance, source type and flight path are
   investigated. By using the efficient simulation solver, the noise impact
   can be quickly assessed through virtual flights, providing a promising
   approach to assist the low-noise flight planning and noise
   certification. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the radiation modes and efficiency of propeller
   tonal noise. The thickness noise and loading noise model of propellers
   has been formulated in spherical coordinates, thereby simplifying
   numerical evaluation of the integral noise source. More importantly, the
   radiation field can be decomposed and projected to spherical harmonics,
   which can separate source-observer positions and enable an analysis of
   sound field structures. Due to the parity of spherical harmonics, the
   proposed model can mathematically explain the fact that thrusts only
   produce antisymmetric sound waves with respect to the rotating plane. In
   addition, the symmetric components of the noise field can be attributed
   to the thickness, as well as drags and radial forces acting on the
   propeller surface. The radiation efficiency of each mode decays rapidly
   as noise sources approach the rotating center, suggesting the radial
   distribution of aerodynamic loadings should be carefully designed for
   low-noise propellers. The noise prediction model has been successfully
   applied to a drone propeller and achieved a reliable agreement with
   experimental measurements. The flow variables employed as an input of
   the noise computation were obtained with computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD), and the experimental data were measured in an anechoic chamber.},

Title = {Computational aeroacoustics of quadcopter drones},
Journal = {APPLIED ACOUSTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {192},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Multicopter drones have a complex geometry involving several rotors.
   Therefore, computational resources could hinder their aeroacoustics
   modelling and simulation. Furthermore, such simulations require solving
   the aerodynamics at different scales (propellers and fuselage) and the
   sound spectrum for observers away from the drone. This paper presents a
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of quadcopter aeroacoustics.
   The computational method combines CFD in the framework of Reynolds
   Averaged Navier-Stokes with the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) model
   for a multi propeller drone. Moreover, we have used the rotor's virtual
   blade model (VBM) to obtain the momentum sources as a first-order
   approximation. We apply the above approach to a quadcopter drone for
   hovering and forward flight conditions and analyse the aeroacoustics
   footprints. The predicted Octave Band Sound Levels are in good agreement
   with experimental data. We demonstrate that the above approach can model
   multi propeller drones accurately at a moderate computational cost.(c)

Abstract = {The aviation sector is rapidly evolving with more electric propulsion
   systems and a variety of new technologies of vertical take-off and
   landing manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. Community noise impact is
   one of the main barriers for the wider adoption of these new vehicles.
   Within the framework of a perception-driven engineering approach, this
   paper investigates the relationship between sound quality and first
   order physical parameters in rotor systems to aid design. Three case
   studies are considered: (i) contra-rotating versus single rotor systems,
   (ii) varying blade diameter and thrust in both contra-rotating and
   single rotor systems, and (iii) varying rotor-rotor axial spacing in
   contra-rotating systems. The outcomes of a listening experiment, where
   participants assessed a series of sound stimuli with varying design
   parameters, allow a better understanding of the annoyance induced by
   rotor noise. Further to this, a psychoacoustic annoyance model optimised
   for rotor noise has been formulated. The model includes a novel
   psychoacoustic function to account for the perceptual effect of
   impulsiveness. The significance of the proposed model lies in the
   quantification of the effects of psychoacoustic factors, such as
   loudness as the dominant factor, and also tonality, high frequency
   content, temporal fluctuations, and impulsiveness on rotor noise
   annoyance.

Abstract = {Multi-rotor powered drones and urban mobility vehicles (UMV) have
   received considerable attention over recent years and attracted
   ever-increasing interest in their aerodynamic noise. Physics-based
   prediction tools for aerodynamic noise are of importance to facilitate
   quiet drone designs. In this work, a boundary element method (BEM) based
   solver is employed to evaluate the scattering of the rotor noise of a
   flying drone fuselage. The possible non-uniqueness of the solution is
   tackled using a Combined Helmholtz Interior integral Equation
   Formulation (CHIEF). The proposed method is applied to evaluate the
   noise scattering by a realistic fuselage configuration. Results suggest
   that the fuselage can visibly redirect propeller noise radiation at low
   frequencies because of wave diffractions. The fuselage can also affect
   the sound field by wave reflections at high frequencies, producing an
   apparent noise reduction.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the development and
   usage of flying drones due to their diverse capabilities worldwide.
   Public and private sectors will actively use drone technology in the
   logistics of goods and transporting passengers in the future. There are
   concerns regarding privacy and noise exposure in and around the rural
   and urban environment with the rapid expansion. Further, drone noise
   could affect human health. European Union has defined a
   service-orientated architecture to provide air traffic management for
   drones, called U-space. However, it lacks a noise modelling service
   (NMS). This paper proposes a conceptual framework for such a noise
   modelling service for drones with a use case scenario and verification
   method. The framework is conceptualized based on noise modelling from
   the aviation sector. The NMS can be used to model the noise to
   understand the accepted drone noise levels in different scenarios and
   take measures needed to reduce the noise impact on the community.},

Title = {Drone Audition: Sound Source Localization Using On-Board Microphones},
Journal = {IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {508-519},
Abstract = {This paper presents a sound source localization method using an
   irregular microphone array embedded in a drone. Sound source
   localization is an integral function of drone audition systems which
   enables various applications of drones such as search and rescue
   missions. However, the audio recordings using the on-board microphones
   obscure the sound emitted by a source on the ground due to drone
   generated motor and propeller noise, thus leading to an extremely low
   signal-to-drone noise ratio (SdNR). In this paper, we propose a
   cross-correlation based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation technique
   using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) at different microphone
   pairs, with noise angular spectrum subtraction. Through the measured
   current-specific drone noise spectrum, noise suppression has been
   achieved from the multi-channel recordings. Experimental results show
   that the proposed method is capable of estimating the position in
   three-dimensional space for simultaneously active multiple sound sources
   on the ground at low SdNR conditions (-30 dB), and localize two sound
   sources located at a certain azimuth angular separation with low
   prediction error comparable to the multiple signal classification
   (MUSIC) based algorithms and the generalized crass-correlation with
   phase transformation (GCC-PHAT) method. Due to its simplicity,
   applicability to any array geometry, and better robustness against drone
   noise, the proposed method increases the feasibility of localization
   under extreme SdNR levels.},

Abstract = {Blade vortex interaction noise is a problematic and dominant component
   of rotor noise. Plasma actuators strategically placed at the tip of the
   rotor blades can reduce the strength of the tip vortices. This reduction
   has the potential to significantly reduce blade vortex interaction
   noise. A combined experimental, numerical, and theoretical program shows
   supporting evidence that low power plasma actuators can effectively
   lower coherence of the blade tip vortex and reduce blade vortex
   interaction noise over-pressure by up to 80\%. For a nominal small
   five-bladed unmanned aerial vehicle, we predict an approximate 8.88
   maximum Delta dB reduction for a 150 m/s tip speed. Experimental,
   computational, and acoustic modeling support these predictions. This
   study represents a fundamental investigation in the fixed-frame, which
   provides evidence for higher level research and testing in a rotating
   framework.},

Abstract = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones have become
   ubiquitous in our daily lives, bringing great convenience to our lives
   and playing a pivotal role in future wireless networks and the Internet
   of things. One of the major problems associated with the UAV is the
   heterogeneous nature of such deployments; this heterogeneity poses many
   challenges, particularly in the areas of security and privacy. The key
   to solving these problems is to accurately identify and authenticate
   drones. In this article, a reliable UAV identify framework based on
   radio frequency fingerprint is proposed. First, we established a
   wireless signal label architecture and systematically collected,
   analyzed, and recorded the radio frequency signals of different UAVs in
   different flight modes and different distances in the telemetry link,
   and established UAV signal datasets. Then, the intelligent algorithm and
   anti-UAV system are designed by using the collected dataset, and the
   feasibility of the developed dataset for detecting and identifying UAVs
   is verified by using machine learning and deep learning. The simulation
   results show that under the condition of Gaussian white noise, the
   method based on deep learning achieves high reliability, and when the
   SNR is not less than 5dB, the model achieves more than 95\% of the
   monitoring and recognition accuracy. Finally, we discussed the possible
   applications of the dataset in the future.},

Title = {Sound Propagation Modelling for Manned and Unmanned Aircraft Noise
   Assessment and Mitigation: A Review},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper addresses one of the recognized barriers to the unrestricted
   adoption of Unmanned Aircraft (UA) in mainstream urban use-noise-and
   reviews existing approaches for estimating and mitigating this problem.
   The aircraft noise problem is discussed upfront in general terms by
   introducing the sound emission, propagation, and psychoacoustic effects.
   The propagation of sound in the atmosphere, which is the focus of this
   paper, is then analysed in detail to isolate the environmental and
   operational factors that predominantly influence the perceived noise on
   the ground, especially looking at large-scale low-altitude UA
   operations, such as in the envisioned Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts.
   The physics of sound propagation are presented, considering all
   attenuation effects and the anomalies due to Doppler and atmospheric
   effects, such as wind, thermal inversion, and turbulence. The analysis
   allows to highlight the limitations of current mainstream aircraft noise
   modelling and certification approaches and, in particular, their
   inadequacy in addressing the noise of UA and, more generally, UAM
   vehicles. This finding is important considering that, although reducing
   noise at the source has remained a priority for manufacturers to enable
   the scaling up of UAM and drone delivery operations in the near future,
   the impact of poorly considered propagation and psychoacoustic effects
   on the actual perceived noise on the ground is equally important for the
   same objective. For instance, optimizing the flight paths as a function
   of local weather conditions can significantly contribute to minimizing
   the impact of noise on communities, thus paving the way for the
   introduction of full-scale UAM operations. A more reliable and accurate
   modelling of noise ground signatures for both manned and unmanned
   low-flying aircraft will aid in identifying the real-time data stream
   requirements from distributed sensors on the ground. New developments in
   surrogate sound propagation models, more pervasive real-time sensor
   data, and suitable computing resources are expected to both yield more
   reliable and effective estimates of noise reaching the ground listeners
   and support a dynamic planning of flight paths.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) passive detection is an essential part of
   intelligent surveillance in the Internet of Space Things (IoST). The
   satellite has the potential to play a vital role in many applications of
   IoST. This paper proposes a novel UAV passive detection using multiple
   satellites. Specifically, we consider target detection in the ground
   dual receiver system, which is divided into reference channel and
   monitoring channel. The reference channel receives the direct wave
   signals from multiple external emitters, and the monitoring channel
   receives the echo signals reflected by the UAV. We propose a multiple
   satellite joint target detection method based on a generalized
   likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This detection algorithm is robust to the
   reference channel noise. According to the known or unknown noise
   variance and interference targets, the conditions are divided into three
   types, where we use GLRT to design the detectors under different
   conditions. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the
   performance of the algorithm under various parameter settings. (C) 2021

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study evaluating the human
   perception of the noise produced by four different small quadcopter
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This study utilised measurements and
   recordings of the noise produced by the quadcopter UAVs in hover and in
   constant-speed flight at a fixed altitude. Measurements made using a 1/2
   `' microphone were used to calculate a range of different noise metrics
   for each noise event. Noise recordings were also made using a spherical
   microphone array (an Eigenmike system). The recordings were reproduced
   using a 3D sound reproduction system installed in a large anechoic
   chamber located at The University of Auckland. Thirty-seven participants
   were subjected to the recordings and asked to rate their levels of
   annoyance in response to the noise, and asked to perform a simple
   cognitive task in order to assess the level of distraction caused by the
   noise. This study discusses the noise levels measured during the test
   and how the various noise metrics relate to the annoyance ratings. It
   was found that annoyance strongly correlates with the sound pressure
   level and loudness metrics, and that there is a very strong correlation
   between the annoyance caused by a UAV in hover and in flyby at the same
   height. While some significant differences between the distraction
   caused by the UAV noise for different cases were observed in the
   cognitive distraction test, the results were inconclusive. This was
   likely due to a ceiling effect observed in the participants' test
   scores.},

Abstract = {The increasing of illegal radiations, which are either artificial or
   unintentional, has seriously influenced the reliable communication and
   operation of industrial facilities. In this article, we discuss the
   simultaneous localization of multiple emitters based on big data
   monitored by a moving unmanned aerial vehicle. Conventional direct
   position determination (DPD) method suffers from the non-homogeneity of
   the observation error and is sensitive to the environment, so we develop
   the weight DPD methods. First, we consider to strengthen the spectrums
   obtained at slots with higher signal-to-noise ratio, which is blindly
   calculated. Thereafter, an improved weight is designed to further
   enhance the localization accuracy, and it can obtain the asymptotically
   optimal performance under the general Gaussian noise model, which is
   proved theoretically. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the
   proposed weight DPD methods outperform the conventional two-step methods
   and subspace data fusion DPD method in terms of localization accuracy
   and resolution.},

Abstract = {Multiple propellers are usually used in unmanned aerial vehicles. This
   work studies the aerodynamic and acoustic properties of dual propellers
   in close vicinity. Aerodynamic and acoustic tests of the side-by-side
   propellers were conducted in an anechoic chamber, and the flow
   recirculation effect was considered in the analysis to reduce
   uncertainties in the results. We mainly focused on the influence of the
   propeller separation distance for various propellers at different
   rotational speeds and rotational directions. For the cases studied, the
   results indicate that there is a negligible interactional effect on the
   mean thrust, tonal noise at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and the
   overall sound pressure level (OASPL) at most observation angles. For the
   observers apart from the wake region, the noise radiated from the dual
   propellers could be approximatively assessed by simple superimposition
   of different propellers. Numerical simulations are also conducted to
   investigate the flow field of the dual-propeller configuration. It is
   found that the unsteady wake flow from each propeller is contractive,
   leading to little mutual effect. The study might be beneficial to
   simplification of relevant acoustic modeling process and noise
   prediction of drone propellers.},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in recent years, are developing
   rapidly. However, when fly into private residences or public areas
   without authorizations, UAVs pose latent threats to personal privacy and
   public security. UAVs localization is a significant part of an anti-UAV
   system. In this paper, a remolded acoustic energy decay model preserved
   relative in acoustic energy attenuation inverse of distance square is
   used to generate training data. Multilayer perceptron(MLP) is the model
   to train these data and predicts accurate relative 3D space coordinates.
   Four different UAV flight trajectories are simulated. We also test
   robustness against noise with different levels. Simulation experiment
   results show that the deviation is less than 1.48 m in specific
   distances and noise levels, even with higher noise levels the deviation
   can still be accepted. The problem of limited detection range is
   overcome by the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with more
   sensors. Long and short-term memory (LSTM) is investigated, but it
   doesn't outperform MLP in accuracy and processing time.},

Abstract = {Possibilities to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly
   growing. With the development of battery technologies, communication,
   navigation, surveillance, and autonomous systems in general, many UAVs
   are expected to operate at relatively low altitudes. Thus, the problem
   of UAV noise impact on human health and well-being will be more
   pronounced. In this paper, we conducted noise measurements of two UAVs
   of different performance (quadrotor and hexarotor) in flying up and
   down, hovering, and overflight procedures. Respondents of good hearing
   who were confirmed by audiogram measurement and had participated in the
   survey during UAV noise measurement gave their subjective assessments on
   the UAV noise perception. UAV noise measurements and subjective
   respondents' assessments were analysed and related. UAV noise analysis
   showed that the parameters measured at the same measurement point for
   the hexarotor were higher than those for the quadrotor in flying up and
   down and flying-over procedures. Low frequency noise was present in the
   noise spectrum of both drones. Participants were able to distinguish
   between the noise of UAVs and had a generally more negative experience
   with the hexarotor. Regardless of the noise perception, more than 80\%
   of the respondents believe there are more pros than cons for UAV
   introduction into everyday life.},

Abstract = {We propose a legal full-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   surveillance system in the presence of the ground-to-ground suspicious
   link with antisurveillance technology. UAV performs passive surveillance
   and active jamming simultaneously, and the suspicious source with
   multiantenna employs artificial noise to avoid being monitored. In order
   to ensure effective surveilling, we adopt two beamforming schemes,
   namely, maximum ratio transmission (MRT)/receiving zero-forcing (RZF)
   and transmitting zero-forcing (TZF)/maximum ratio combing (MRC), for
   MIMO UAV. For the two beamforming schemes, we derive the surveilling
   nonoutage probability in a closed-form expression and analyze the
   surveilling performance under different system environments. Monte Carlo
   (MC) simulation validates the correctness of the formula.},

Abstract = {Swarms of drones is an emerging field of research and technology.
   Multicopter drones are noisy machines, and the noise effects would
   increase for a swarm. It is, therefore, essential to understand what
   flight formation conditions would reduce noise emissions. This study
   concerns the noise induced by drone swarms. We developed a
   high-resolution computational methodology for predicting aeroacoustic
   footprints emitted from a swarm of multi-copter drones. We show that a
   V-flight formation emits less sound pressure level noise than a U-shape
   (or rectangular) formation. We also demonstrate that the V-shape flight
   formation induces reduced drag, thus saving energy. This research's
   impact is broad, including defence and security, public health,
   transportation, and surveillance, among others. Published under an

Abstract = {High-fidelity simulations of the unsteady flow and radiated noise of an
   unmanned aerial vehicle's propeller are presented herein. The aim of
   this study is to capture the broad-band noise associated with both the
   propeller and its wake. The current results are found to be in good
   agreement with several data, including the thrust generated, the
   unsteady flow structure, as well as the radiated sound spectra and
   directivity. This study focuses on understanding the physics of the
   turbulence-generated noise and how it propagates to the acoustic near
   and far fields. This is analyzed by computing the dilatation field, the
   Lighthill's stress tensor, as well as each term in the
   Ffowcs-Williams-Hawking's integral solution of the far field.},

Title = {Sound quality factors influencing annoyance from hovering UAV},

Year = {2020},

Month = {DEC 22},
Abstract = {This study investigates psychoacoustic aspects of the noise of
   multi-rotor type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Two psychoacoustic
   experiments were performed for a dual purpose: to examine the difference
   of annoyance induced by the noise from three types of UAVs and a civil
   aircraft and also to identify the acoustic factors influencing the
   annoyance from UAV noise. In the first experiment, the annoyance of each
   stimulus was quantified from psychoacoustic tests and compared with each
   other. The psychoacoustic tests confirms that UAV noise generally causes
   more annoyance than civil aircraft noise at the same loudness level. The
   physical and psychoacoustic indices of the stimuli were analyzed
   statistically using principal component analysis and regression. The
   loudness, sharpness and fluctuation strength were derived as significant
   factors that affect the annoyance of UAV noise. In the second
   experiment, six new sound samples were created by modifying the
   sharpness and the fluctuation strength of one representative UAV noise
   to check the results of the first experiment. Regressions of the test
   results reaffirmed that the sharpness and fluctuation strength are
   significant in the annoyance of UAV noise. (C) 2020 Published by

Title = {Model of Third-Party Risk Index for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Delivery in
   Urban Environment},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In order to assess the airspace risk of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   operating at low altitudes, the third-party risks of UAV urban
   operations were defined: the risks caused by drones to people on the
   ground who are not involved in operations and do not profit from
   operations, and the sources and objects of the risk were clarified.
   Taking into account the drone crash, noise, on-board camera, and ground
   environment factors, a UAV urban logistics risk index evaluation model
   was constructed. First, the UAV image regression model was used to
   construct a three-dimensional grid, and then a comprehensive third-party
   risk index model of UAV urban logistics was built based on the casualty
   and noise risks. Finally, the Southern District of Civil Aviation
   University of China was selected as an example scene, and surface data
   were obtained through a field investigation and instrument measurements.
   Then, the risk of drone operations in the airspace 30-60 m above this
   area was evaluated. The results showed that the third-party risk was
   lower when the UAV flying altitude above a building was greater.
   However, in other areas such as lakes, woods, roads, open spaces, a
   lower flight altitude had a lower risk. A comparison of the whole
   airspace showed that the third-party risk was the lowest when the drone
   operated at an altitude of 30 m. The results also showed that the
   third-party risk above the lake and greenery was the lowest when on the
   same plane, followed by the lower risk above the buildings and open
   squares, with the highest third-party risk above the canteen passage.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for wildlife
   research and monitoring, but little information exists on their
   potential effect on marine mammals. We assessed the effects of a UAV on
   the behavior of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) in
   Australia. Focal follows of ten right whale mother-calf pairs were
   conducted using a theodolite. Control data were recorded for 30 min, and
   then a DJI Inspire 1 Pro was flown above the whales for 10 min at 5 m
   altitude. Potential changes to horizontal behavior (swim speed and
   turning angle) and surfacing pattern (interbreath intervals) were
   investigated by comparing mother-calf behavior before and during UAV
   approaches. Changes in respiration rate were used to quantify energetic
   effects. We also explored acoustic cue perceptibility of the UAV at 5,
   10, and 30 m altitude, by measuring the received UAV underwater noise
   level on whales equipped with acoustic tags (DTAGs). The received noise
   levels were 86.0 +/- 3.9 dB re 1 mu Pa, while the measured ambient noise
   was 80.7 +/- 7.3 dB re 1 mu Pa in the same frequency band (100-1,500
   Hz). No behavioral response to the UAV was observed. This provides
   support for UAVs as a noninvasive tool to study baleen whale behavior
   and ecophysiology.},

Abstract = {The multi-rotor type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) controls the movement
   through the rotational speed of each rotor. Since the phase of each
   rotor is different and minute variations of the rotational speed are
   always accompanied during flight, frequency modulation of the drone
   noise occurs. In this study, a new approach, called the rotation per
   minute (RPM) fluctuation correction method, was developed to consider
   the frequency modulation effects through correcting the signals
   predicted by the classical rotorcraft noise prediction methods. For
   verification of the suggested method, two experiments were performed for
   a single isolated rotor and a full vehicle. The measured spectra of the
   isolated rotor were used for verifying the spectrum before the
   correction. Also, the spectra corrected by the RPM fluctuation
   correction method were compared and verified with the noise of the full
   vehicle, which has frequency modulation effects.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses issues with monitoring systems that identify and
   track illegal drones. The development of drone technologies promotes the
   widespread commercial application of drones. However, the ability of a
   drone to carry explosives and other destructive materials may pose
   serious threats to public safety. In order to reduce these threats, we
   propose an acoustic-based scheme for positioning and tracking of illegal
   drones. Our proposed scheme has three main focal points. First, we scan
   the sky with switched beamforming to find sound sources and record the
   sounds using a microphone array; second, we perform classification with
   a hidden Markov model (HMM) in order to know whether the sound is a
   drone or something else. Finally, if the sound source is a drone, we use
   its recorded sound as a reference signal for tracking based on adaptive
   beamforming. Simulations are conducted under both ideal conditions
   (without background noise and interference sounds) and non-ideal
   conditions (with background noise and interference sounds), and we
   evaluate the performance when tracking illegal drones.},

Title = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Relay System: Performance Evaluation and 3D
   Location Optimization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in wireless
   communication as a flying base station (BS) or relay is expected to be
   dominant in the following years to enhance wireless network performance
   in terms of coverage and capacity owing to their ability to change
   altitude, easy 3D movement, low cost, and easy deployment in wireless
   networks. In this paper, we study the performance of a wireless network
   in which a UAV is employed as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay linking a
   ground base station (BS) with multiple users in area where direct
   terrestrial path between the ground BS and the users is assumed to be
   blocked. The channel between the BS and the UAV is assumed to follow
   Rician channel model, while the links between the UAV and the end users
   are assumed to follow Rayleigh fading model with opportunistic
   scheduling scheme for user selection. Closed-form expressions for the
   outage probability and average symbol error rate (ASER) are derived. Due
   to complexity of the derived closed-form expressions and in order to get
   more insights at the system behavior in terms of system coding gain and
   diversity order, an asymptotic expression is derived for the outage
   probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Furthermore, an
   optimization of the UAV 3D location that minimizes the asymptotic outage
   probability is achieved. Our numerical results show that increasing the
   UAV transmit power much more than the ground BS transmit power does not
   improve the system performance. The increase in the UAV transmit power
   is positive only if the ground BS transmit power is higher than the UAV
   transmit power. We also show that the increase of the Rician -factor
   leads to improving the system performance when the ground BS transmit
   power is less than or close to the UAV transmit power. Furthermore, the
   proposed optimization scheme shows superior performance gain in
   minimizing the outage probability compared to the conventional
   scenarios, where the UAV is located at a fixed altitude over the center
   of the coverage region.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the small drone propeller noise, particularly
   the discrete blade passing frequency (BPF) tone and its harmonics at low
   frequencies less than 1000 Hz. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes equations were solved to investigate the steady and
   unsteady loading noise sources around the blades with a radius of 17 cm
   rotating at 5000 rpm (a blade tip Mach number is 0.264). The uRANS
   computations showed eccentric ellipsoidal isobaric surfaces on the upper
   and lower blade surfaces identified as a steady loading noise source of
   the drone propeller. A simple mathematical model of an ellipsoidal
   steady loading noise with the lattice Boltzmann method predicted the BPF
   tone and even-number harmonics comparable to NASA's SPL measurement of
   two different APC 1147 SF and DJI 9443 CF drone propellers. The decaying
   rate of -6 in the SPL spectrum was quite closely matched for the first
   two discrete tones. The transient pressure fluctuation characteristics
   on the upper surface of the rotating blades revealed that the unsteady
   loading noise by blade-vortex interactions is found most closely related
   to the third and sixth harmonics of the round per second noise. An
   unexpected fifth component also arose in some other rotational speeds
   because of the random nature of the phase difference of pressure
   fluctuations, even at the same positions of the two propeller blades.},

Title = {Assessing the disturbance potential of small unoccupied aircraft systems
   (UAS) on gray seals (<i>Halichoerus grypus</i>) at breeding colonies in
   Nova Scotia, Canada},
Journal = {PEERJ},

Abstract = {The use of small unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) for ecological
   studies and wildlife population assessments is increasing. These methods
   can provide significant benefits in terms of costs and reductions in
   human risk, but little is known if UAS-based approaches cause
   disturbance of animals during operations. To address this knowledge gap,
   we conducted a series of UAS flights at gray seal breeding colonies on
   Hay and Saddle Islands in Nova Scotia, Canada. Using a small fixed-wing
   UAS, we assessed both immediate and short-term effects of surveys using
   sequential image analysis and between-flight seal counts in ten, 50 m(2)
   random quadrats at each colony. Counts of adult gray seals and
   young-of-the-year animals between first and second flights revealed no
   changes in abundance in quadrats (matched pair t-test p > 0.69) and
   slopes approaching 1 for linear regression comparisons (r(2) > 0.80).
   Sequential image analysis revealed no changes in orientation or posture
   of imaged animals. We also assessed the acoustic properties of the small
   UAS in relation to low ambient noise conditions using sound equivalent
   level (Leq) measurements with a calibrated U-MIK 1 and a 1/3 octave band
   soundscape approach. The results of Leq measurements indicate that small
   fixed-wing UAS are quiet, with most energy above 160 Hz, and that levels
   across 1/3 octave bands do not greatly exceed ambient acoustic
   measurements in a quiet field during operations at standard survey
   altitudes. As such, this platform is unlikely to acoustically disturb
   gray seals at breeding colonies during population surveys. The results
   of the present study indicate that the effects of small fixed-wing UAS
   on gray seals at breeding colonies are negligible, and that fixed-wing
   UAS-based approaches should be considered amongst best practices for
   assessing gray seal colonies.},

Abstract = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed and
   studied for various applications, including drone deliveries,
   broadcasting, scouting, crop dusting, and firefighting. To enable the
   wide use of UAVs, their exact aeroacoustic characteristics must be
   assessed. In this study, a noise prediction method for a,ducted fan UAV
   with complicated geometry was developed. In general, calculation
   efficiency is increased by simulating a ducted fan UAV without the
   struts that fix the fuselage to the ducts. However, numerical
   predictions of noise and aerodynamics differ according to whether struts
   are present. In terms of aerodynamic performance, the total thrust with
   and without struts is similar owing to the tendency of the thrust of
   a'blade to offset the drag of the struts. However, in aeroacoustic
   simulations, the strut effect should be considered in order to predict
   the UAV's noise because noise from the blades can be changed by the
   strut effect. Modelling of the strut effect revealed that the dominant
   tonal noises were closely correlated with the blade passage frequency of
   the experimental results. Based on the successful detection of noise
   sources from a ducted fan UAV system, using the proposed noise
   contribution contour, methods for noise reduction can be suggested by
   comparing numerical results with measured noise profiles.},

Abstract = {Amiet's theory is an airfoil noise prediction technique adopted in the
   industrial design of applications such as wind-turbines, turbomachinery,
   ventilation systems and drones. This methodology uses Schwarzschild's
   technique in an iterative procedure where the second calculation can
   only be computed in terms of approximate analytical expression. After
   two iterations Amiet's noise prediction is precise at high-frequencies,
   however generally overestimated in the frequency range where the airfoil
   is considered a compact noise source- acoustic wavelength comparable to
   the chord. This paper applies two extra iterations of Schwarzschild's
   technique to improve the methodology convergence in the compact airfoil
   regime. This approach is combined with analytical correction formulas
   derived to maintain the solution accuracy after four iterative
   application of Schwarzschild's technique. Results show that, in the
   compact airfoil regime, two extra iterations contribute to improved
   noise prediction convergence and enhanced agreement with experimental
   data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Noise Levels of Multi-Rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Implications
   for Potential Underwater Impacts on Marine Mammals},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Despite the rapid increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   in marine mammal research, knowledge of the effects of UAVs on study
   animals is very limited. We recorded the in-air and in-water noise from
   two commonly used multi-rotor UAVs, the SwellPro Splashdrone and the DJI
   Inspire 1 Pro, to assess the potential for negative noise effects of UAV
   use. The Splashdrone and Inspire UAVs produced broad-band in-air source
   levels of 80 dB re 20 mu Pa and 81 dB re 20 mu Pa (rms), with
   fundamental frequencies centered at 60 Hz and 150 Hz. The noise of the
   UAVs coupled poorly into the water, and could only be quantified above
   background noise of the recording sites at 1 m depth when flying at
   altitudes of 5 and 10 m, resulting in broad-band received levels around
   95 dB re mu Pa rms for the Splashdrone and around 101 dB re mu Pa rms
   for the Inspire. The third octave levels of the underwater UAV noise
   profiles are (i) close to ambient noise levels in many shallow water
   habitats, (ii) largely below the hearing thresholds at low frequencies
   of toothed whales, but (iii) likely above the hearing thresholds of
   baleen whales and pinnipeds. So while UAV noise may be heard by some
   marine mammals underwater, it is implied that the underwater noise
   effect is small, even for animals close to the water surface. Our
   findings will be valuable for wildlife managers and regulators when
   issuing permits and setting guidelines for UAV operations. Further, our
   experimental setup can be used by others to evaluate noise effects of
   larger sized UAVs on marine mammals.},
