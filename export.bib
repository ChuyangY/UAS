	abstract={The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the Lattice-Boltzmann/Very-Large-Eddy-Simulation CFD solver SIMULIA PowerFLOW ® when a transitional flow past a small drone rotor blade is simulated, without using any numerical or physical turbulence triggering system. A recently developed variant of PowerFLOW VLES model is validated against measurements performed at Delft University of Technology. A 2-bladed propeller of 0.3 m diameter is considered, which is operated at 4000 and 5000 RPM and two different advance ratios, 0.0 and 0.6, for each angular velocity. In such conditions, corresponding to a Reynolds number based on the chord at 75% of the tip radius ranging between 7 • 10 4 and 9 • 10 4 , the presence of a laminar separation bubble was experimentally observed and related to the occurrence of a high-frequency broadband noise hump in the far-field noise spectra. The numerical results are in a good agreement with the loading, noise and PIV experimental measurements, demonstrating the capability of the new PowerFLOW VLES model to predict boundary layer flow transitional phenomena such as laminar separation, reattachment and transition to turbulence, as well as the corresponding broadband trailing-edge noise radiation.},

	abstract={There is a growing interest for commercial applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, but important foundations for an assessment, among others about noise, are missing. This contribution specifically focuses on a method to measure and model the sound radiation of multicopters. The emission prediction is hereby based on measurements using a multiple regression approach. An important finding is that the directivity pattern is widely independent of the rotational speed of the rotors and of the flight procedure. Consequently, the directivity pattern can be determined for a stationary hover flight, which considerably simplifies the measurement procedure. In addition to a rotational speed-dependent sound emission model for hover flight, a multicopter-specific correction term is required to account for forward flight. The validity of this approach is demonstrated based on the field measurements of three different multicopter models.},

	abstract={This work presents a high-efficiency low-noise propeller design for unmanned aerial vehicles. Three different blade configurations are first investigated, using the computational aeroacoustic approach to recognize the flow around propellers and the noise emissions. The flow simulation is obtained by an acoustic-wave preserved artificial compressibility method, and the far-field noise is extrapolated by solving the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equations. Experiments are also conducted to validate numerical simulations and the design philosophy. The comparison between numerical and experimental results confirms an encouraging agreement regarding aerodynamic efficiency, noise spectra and differences between propellers. The results show that two designed propellers can simultaneously improve aerodynamic efficiency and reduce noise emissions compared to the baseline propeller. It is observed that using a longer chord length and shorter propeller radius can reduce flow separation at the trailing edge. Furthermore, a qualitative noise-source analysis shows that broadband noise sources are primarily ascribed to the time-derivative of blade surface pressure and occur at the trailing edge near the tip.

	abstract={The noise signature of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) is highly influenced by specific operating and weather conditions. Accurate noise assessment of sUAS operations requires field noise measurements that capture all the complexity of sound emission and propagation during realistic flight situations. This paper presents a measurement and analysis framework for the acoustic characterisation of sUAS through the calculation of conventional noise metrics (LAmax and LAE), frequency and directivity features. Using a multi-channel measurement approach, and back-propagating the sound from ground microphone to source, the presented framework allows the calculation of acoustic hemispheres for a selection of acoustic metrics. Important findings are that (i) the framework is robust for a variety of multi-rotor sUAS varying in size and configuration; (ii) broadband noise and tonal noise are the dominant noise sources during flyover for larger sUAS and smaller sUAS respectively; (iii) the maximum noise radiation of the sUAS tested is found in the rear arc of polar directivity; and (iv) angles of maximum radiation of amplitude modulated noise have been found for most sUAS tested at 0 angles & PLUSMN;30 degrees. This work is intended to be relevant in establishing common protocols regarding sUAS acoustic certification between environmental policymakers, stakeholders, and industry.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract={The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of flow confinement on the noise generated by a small unmanned aerial system rotor measured and simulated in a partially closed test room. More specifically, the influence of the flow recirculation in the test room and the consequent blade turbulence interaction on both the tonal unsteady loading noise and the broadband laminar separation noise components are scrutinized. The study also aims at improving our prediction capabilities of drone rotor noise, and deepening our fundamental knowledge of rotor aeroacoustics in transitional boundary layer regimes. Numerical simulations are conducted by means of a scale-resolving wall-modelled lattice Boltzmann solver to calculate the unsteady flow and the noise generated by the same reference configuration used in our previous works, which consists in a rotor operated at a chord-based Reynolds number of about 70000 at 75% of the tip radius, both in hover and axial flow conditions. Results for a rotor in pristine flow conditions are compared to results obtained by simulating the rotor in a confined environment that reproduces the A-Tunnel test chamber of Delft University of Technology. On one hand, our study reveals that previously observed discrepancies between measured and predicted noise spectra in hover conditions are not due to the influence of the flow confinement on the laminar separation mechanisms, as hypothesized in our previous study, rather to a lack of numerical resolution. On the other hand, the new results reveal that, in hover conditions, the dominant effect of the flow recirculation is to increase the unsteady loading tonal noise components, whereas, in axial flow conditions, no significant effect due to the test environment is observed. Some of our conclusive observations are supported by results obtained using a source identification technique herein presented for the first time.},

	abstract={This paper presents a detailed investigation of tonal noise produced by an unmanned aerial vehicle propeller operating with a circular strut mounted just downstream. Experimental measurements of the acoustic pressure in near- and far-fields are presented, and it is observed that the measured pressure signals contain a strong impulse caused by the propeller-strut interaction. The magnitude and shape of this impulse vary significantly with an observer location. It was also observed that the magnitude of these impulses was reduced by increasing the distance between the propeller and the strut. In order to investigate the physics of the noise generation mechanism, a number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed, and a numerical method was developed to predict the radiated acoustic tones using the CFD data. This analysis showed that the unsteady loading sources on the strut and the propeller both made significant contributions to the total impulse, and the directivity of the sound radiated from the strut was different from that radiated from the propeller. Therefore, the addition of the signals from the propeller and the strut produced a pressure impulse, which had a complex directivity. Analytical models were also developed to estimate the unsteady loading on the propeller and strut from which estimates of the radiated noise field could be made. Predictions made using these models are compared with CFD predictions and experimental measurements of the unsteady loading on the strut and also the total radiated noise field and show reasonable agreement.

	abstract={Drone-monitoring radars typically integrate many pulses in order to improve signal to noise ratio and enable high detection performance. Over the course of this coherent processing interval (CPI), many components of the drone signature change and the signature&#39;s amplitude and Doppler modulations may hinder coherent integration performance, even in the absence of range-Doppler cell migrations. A statistical characterisation of these fluctuations aides radar designers in selecting optimal CPI lengths. This paper presents a statistical analysis of experimental data of nine flying drones, collected with a frequency modulated continuous wave Ku-band radar, and examines the statistical features of the amplitude fluctuations of the drone body and blades as well as the signature decorrelation time. The method of moments is used to estimate the probability density function parameters of different drone spectral components with the aim of informing the development of improved theory for predicting drone signatures and ultimately increasing detection performance. Results show that, on average, the Weibull distribution provided the best mean square error fit to the data for most drone spectral components and drone types, with the Rayleigh distribution being the next best match. These results were further corroborated by a study of detection performance for a fluctuating target. Whilst decorrelation times of the various signatures varied significantly, even for the same drone, results show that an approximate inverse relationship between drone spectral component bandwidth and decorrelation time held, with individual spectral lines decorrelating after tens to hundreds of msec.

	abstract={In this study, the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic characteristics of multirotor electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft in hovering and forward flight are compared using two representative control methods: fixed-pitch control and variable-pitch control (i.e., revolution per minute (RPM) control and collective pitch control). To this end, a comprehensive multirotor noise assessment framework is used to predict the aerodynamics and noise of multirotors controlled by RPM and collective pitch. High-resolution time-frequency analysis is used to clarify the differences in noise spectral characteristics. The findings indicate that blade passage frequency characteristics vary significantly depending on the control method. The phase differences between the rotors of variable-pitch control remain constant irrespective of disturbances or attitude control. In other words, the frequencies of the tone noise do not exhibit short-periodic modulation, unlike those of RPM-controlled multirotor. Additionally, the aeroacoustic characteristics of fixed-pitch and variable-pitch controlled multirotor in response to wind velocity fluctuation are investigated by considering the direction of noise radiation and interference effects. The impact of the turbulent kinetic energy of wind on the noise characteristics is examined by quantifying the noise components associated with aerodynamic unsteadiness in flight. Furthermore, the rotor phase control method can be applied to reduce noise in both control methods. The optimization of rotor phases reduces tone noise significantly at the target observer point without causing aerodynamic losses in variable-pitch controlled multirotor. In contrast, the reduction in tone noise remains relatively limited for fixed-pitch controlled multirotor, as the rotor phase differences are not maintained.},

	abstract={The aviation sector is rapidly evolving with more electric propulsion systems and a variety of new technologies of vertical take-off and landing manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. Community noise impact is one of the main barriers for the wider adoption of these new vehicles. Within the framework of a perception-driven engineering approach, this paper investigates the relationship between sound quality and first order physical parameters in rotor systems to aid design. Three case studies are considered: (i) contra-rotating versus single rotor systems, (ii) varying blade diameter and thrust in both contra-rotating and single rotor systems, and (iii) varying rotor-rotor axial spacing in contra-rotating systems. The outcomes of a listening experiment, where participants assessed a series of sound stimuli with varying design parameters, allow a better understanding of the annoyance induced by rotor noise. Further to this, a psychoacoustic annoyance model optimised for rotor noise has been formulated. The model includes a novel psychoacoustic function to account for the perceptual effect of impulsiveness. The significance of the proposed model lies in the quantification of the effects of psychoacoustic factors, such as loudness as the dominant factor, and also tonality, high frequency content, temporal fluctuations, and impulsiveness on rotor noise annoyance.

	abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly advancing and becoming ubiquitous in an unlimited number of applications, from parcel delivery to people transportation. As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) markets expand, the increased acoustic nuisance on population becomes a more acute problem. Previous aircraft noise assessments have highlighted the necessity of a psychoacoustic metric for quantification of human audio perception. This study presents a framework for estimating propeller-based UAV auditory detection probability on the ground for a listener in a real-life scenario. The detection probability is derived by using its free-field measured acoustic background and estimating the UAV threshold according to a physiological model of the auditory pathway. The method is presented via results of an exemplar measurement in an anechoic environment with a single two- and five-bladed propeller. It was found that the auditory detection probability is primarily affected by the background noise level, whereas the number of blades is a less significant parameter. The significance of the proposed method lies in providing a quantitative evaluation of auditory detection probability of the UAV on the ground in the presence of a given soundscape. The results of this work are of practical significance since the method can aid anyone who plans a hovering flight mode. (C) 2022 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract={This paper focuses on the radiation modes and efficiency of propeller tonal noise. The thickness noise and loading noise model of propellers has been formulated in spherical coordinates, thereby simplifying numerical evaluation of the integral noise source. More importantly, the radiation field can be decomposed and projected to spherical harmonics, which can separate source-observer positions and enable an analysis of sound field structures. Due to the parity of spherical harmonics, the proposed model can mathematically explain the fact that thrusts only produce antisymmetric sound waves with respect to the rotating plane. In addition, the symmetric components of the noise field can be attributed to the thickness, as well as drags and radial forces acting on the propeller surface. The radiation efficiency of each mode decays rapidly as noise sources approach the rotating center, suggesting the radial distribution of aerodynamic loadings should be carefully designed for low-noise propellers. The noise prediction model has been successfully applied to a drone propeller and achieved a reliable agreement with experimental measurements. The flow variables employed as an input of the noise computation were obtained with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the experimental data were measured in an anechoic chamber.},

In this paper, we study a UAV path planning problem under uncertain weather conditions, and design a data-driven dynamic decision support system for multiple types of UAVs. To this end, we categorize all relevant costs into three types, namely, economic, environmental, and social costs, and formulate a nonlinear two-stage stochastic programming model to establish optimal paths for UAV missions under weather uncertainty. We then discretize the nonlinear model and propose a tight linear approximation for the discretized problem to allow for a near real-time implementation. To quantify weather uncertainty, we propose a weather scenario generation algorithm to map ensemble-based weather forecast information to airspace blockage maps. With comprehensive computational studies through simulations, we show that our proposed stochastic approach can lower operating costs by an average of around 6%, where the savings increase as weather conditions become more severe and complex. We also find that, for missions operated by small UAVs, it is not sufficient to determine a path solely based on economic cost minimization, but it should rather be through total cost minimization, which involves environmental and social costs. Considering only the economic cost in the optimization may lead to much higher non-economic costs. However, for missions operated by large UAVs, it is sufficient to determine paths through economic cost optimization, as including environmental and social costs in the optimization process does not result in solutions that are much different from those obtained by considering only the economic costs. For both small and large UAVs, a path established solely through environmental or social cost minimization may not be economically sustainable, as doing so would imply very high economic costs.},

	abstract={This study focuses on the integration of established acoustic prediction techniques directly into a surface-vorticity solver. The main objective is to enhance an aircraft designer's ability to characterize the acoustic signatures generated by urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, in general, and distributed electric propulsion (DEP) concepts, in particular, including unmanned aerial vehicles. Our solver consists of a reliable, surface-vorticity panel code that incorporates viscous boundary-layer corrections. Thus, it offers a computationally efficient commercial tool for conceptual design and preliminary aerodynamic analysis. By implementing the Farassat F1A acoustics formulation directly into the solver, a new intuitive capability is achieved, which is both conversive with modern engineering tools and efficient in setup and speed of execution. In addition to its application to the X-57 high-lift propeller and the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology Tiltwing electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, this capability is systematically demonstrated using three particular case studies. These consist of both single- and six-propeller Joby S4 eVTOL as well as a small eight-propeller Kittyhawk KH-H1 DEP vehicle. Although the details of this tool and underlying equations are showcased in this article, the acoustic metrics that can be effectively used to characterize the noise level generated by a UAM in flight are described in a companion article. By embedding this assortment of insightful metrics into a simple and user-friendly flow solver, a much improved flow-acoustic analysis capability is thereby provided to support the design of future aircraft.

Noise sources on a pair of side-by-side placed small-scale propellers and a flying quad-copter are investigated separately using microphone arrays and the conventional beamforming algorithm. A high-intensity noise source spot is identified within the gap area between two propeller disks, which is a result of the interaction between the blade tip and upwash flow within the gap area. As the two propellers move away from each other, the noise source spot becomes weaker. Similarly, for a quad-copter under realistic flight conditions, the strongest noise sources are observed within the gap between each of two adjacent propellers, showing the feasibility and repeatability of the result obtained in the lab. The results discussed in this paper show that for the low-noise design of a multi-propeller drone, not only is the single propeller noise, but also the propeller interactional noise shall be taken into account.

	abstract={Swarms of drones is an emerging field of research and technology. Multicopter drones are noisy machines, and the noise effects would increase for a swarm. It is, therefore, essential to understand what flight formation conditions would reduce noise emissions. This study concerns the noise induced by drone swarms. We developed a high-resolution computational methodology for predicting aeroacoustic footprints emitted from a swarm of multi-copter drones. We show that a V-flight formation emits less sound pressure level noise than a U-shape (or rectangular) formation. We also demonstrate that the V-shape flight formation induces reduced drag, thus saving energy.

	abstract={Blade vortex interaction noise is a problematic and dominant component of rotor noise. Plasma actuators strategically placed at the tip of the rotor blades can reduce the strength of the tip vortices. This reduction has the potential to significantly reduce blade vortex interaction noise. A combined experimental, numerical, and theoretical program shows supporting evidence that low power plasma actuators can effectively lower coherence of the blade tip vortex and reduce blade vortex interaction noise over-pressure by up to 80%. For a nominal small five-bladed unmanned aerial vehicle, we predict an approximate 8.88 maximum Delta dB reduction for a 150 m/s tip speed. Experimental, computational, and acoustic modeling support these predictions. This study represents a fundamental investigation in the fixed-frame, which provides evidence for higher level research and testing in a rotating framework.},

	abstract={Amiet's theory is an airfoil noise prediction technique adopted in the industrial design of applications such as wind-turbines, turbomachinery, ventilation systems and drones. This methodology uses Schwarzschild's technique in an iterative procedure where the second calculation can only be computed in terms of approximate analytical expression. After two iterations Amiet's noise prediction is precise at high-frequencies, however generally overestimated in the frequency range where the airfoil is considered a compact noise source- acoustic wavelength comparable to the chord. This paper applies two extra iterations of Schwarzschild's technique to improve the methodology convergence in the compact airfoil regime. This approach is combined with analytical correction formulas derived to maintain the solution accuracy after four iterative application of Schwarzschild's technique. Results show that, in the compact airfoil regime, two extra iterations contribute to improved noise prediction convergence and enhanced agreement with experimental data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract={Multiple propellers are usually used in unmanned aerial vehicles. This work studies the aerodynamic and acoustic properties of dual propellers in close vicinity. Aerodynamic and acoustic tests of the side-by-side propellers were conducted in an anechoic chamber, and the flow recirculation effect was considered in the analysis to reduce uncertainties in the results. We mainly focused on the influence of the propeller separation distance for various propellers at different rotational speeds and rotational directions. For the cases studied, the results indicate that there is a negligible interactional effect on the mean thrust, tonal noise at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and the overall sound pressure level (OASPL) at most observation angles. For the observers apart from the wake region, the noise radiated from the dual propellers could be approximatively assessed by simple superimposition of different propellers. Numerical simulations are also conducted to investigate the flow field of the dual-propeller configuration. It is found that the unsteady wake flow from each propeller is contractive, leading to little mutual effect. The study might be beneficial to simplification of relevant acoustic modeling process and noise prediction of drone propellers.},

However, the ability of a drone to carry explosives and other destructive materials may pose serious threats to public safety. In order to reduce these threats, we propose an acoustic-based scheme for positioning and tracking of illegal drones. Our proposed scheme has three main focal points. First, we scan the sky with switched beamforming to find sound sources and record the sounds using a microphone array; second, we perform classification with a hidden Markov model (HMM) in order to know whether the sound is a drone or something else. Finally, if the sound source is a drone, we use its recorded sound as a reference signal for tracking based on adaptive beamforming. Simulations are conducted under both ideal conditions (without background noise and interference sounds) and non-ideal conditions (with background noise and interference sounds), and we evaluate the performance when tracking illegal drones.},

	abstract={Multicopter drones have a complex geometry involving several rotors. Therefore, computational resources could hinder their aeroacoustics modelling and simulation. Furthermore, such simulations require solving the aerodynamics at different scales (propellers and fuselage) and the sound spectrum for observers away from the drone. This paper presents a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of quadcopter aeroacoustics. The computational method combines CFD in the framework of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes with the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) model for a multi propeller drone. Moreover, we have used the rotor's virtual blade model (VBM) to obtain the momentum sources as a first-order approximation. We apply the above approach to a quadcopter drone for hovering and forward flight conditions and analyse the aeroacoustics footprints. The predicted Octave Band Sound Levels are in good agreement with experimental data. We demonstrate that the above approach can model multi propeller drones accurately at a moderate computational cost.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract={This paper investigates the effect of an acoustically rigid shroud on the tonal noise produced by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) propeller. Enclosing the propeller with a shroud alters the steady loading on the propeller blades, thereby changing the steady loading tones radiated from the sources on the propeller surface. In this paper it is shown that the time-average rotating pressure field on the inner surface of the shroud also makes a significant contribution to the tonal noise. The aerodynamics of a shrouded and an isolated propeller was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The tones produced by the steady loading and thickness sources on the propeller, and the time-average rotating pressure field on the surface of the shroud were calculated using an acoustic analogy approach and data from the CFD simulations. These calculations show that the tonal noise radiated from the loading sources on the inner surface of the shroud make a significant contribution to the tonal noise levels and that the contribution from the loading sources on the other surfaces of the shroud are negligible. A probe microphone was used to measure the time-average rotating pressure field on the inner surface of the shroud and these measurements showed good agreement with the CFD simulation. These measurements were then used to calculate the contribution of the loading sources on the inner surface of the shroud to the total noise measured experimentally. High resolution acoustic measurements in the near-field of a shrouded and an isolated propeller were also taken. The near-field measurements were then projected to the acoustic far-field and these levels are compared with numerical predictions. The results show that the effect of the shroud is to decrease the tonal noise for observers below the rotational plane of the propeller. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract={This paper presents a sound source localization method using an irregular microphone array embedded in a drone. Sound source localization is an integral function of drone audition systems which enables various applications of drones such as search and rescue missions. However, the audio recordings using the on-board microphones obscure the sound emitted by a source on the ground due to drone generated motor and propeller noise, thus leading to an extremely low signal-to-drone noise ratio (SdNR). In this paper, we propose a cross-correlation based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation technique using the time difference of arrival (TDOA) at different microphone pairs, with noise angular spectrum subtraction. Through the measured current-specific drone noise spectrum, noise suppression has been achieved from the multi-channel recordings. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of estimating the position in three-dimensional space for simultaneously active multiple sound sources on the ground at low SdNR conditions (-30 dB), and localize two sound sources located at a certain azimuth angular separation with low prediction error comparable to the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) based algorithms and the generalized crass-correlation with phase transformation (GCC-PHAT) method. Due to its simplicity, applicability to any array geometry, and better robustness against drone noise, the proposed method increases the feasibility of localization under extreme SdNR levels.},

	abstract={This study investigates psychoacoustic aspects of the noise of multi-rotor type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Two psychoacoustic experiments were performed for a dual purpose: to examine the difference of annoyance induced by the noise from three types of UAVs and a civil aircraft and also to identify the acoustic factors influencing the annoyance from UAV noise. In the first experiment, the annoyance of each stimulus was quantified from psychoacoustic tests and compared with each other. The psychoacoustic tests confirms that UAV noise generally causes more annoyance than civil aircraft noise at the same loudness level. The physical and psychoacoustic indices of the stimuli were analyzed statistically using principal component analysis and regression. The loudness, sharpness and fluctuation strength were derived as significant factors that affect the annoyance of UAV noise. In the second experiment, six new sound samples were created by modifying the sharpness and the fluctuation strength of one representative UAV noise to check the results of the first experiment. Regressions of the test results reaffirmed that the sharpness and fluctuation strength are significant in the annoyance of UAV noise. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

This study investigates new quiet propeller designs that have different twist angle distributions that vary the lift generated along the span of the propeller blade to reduce the thrust loading near the tip. In addition, nine co-rotating dual propellers with different phase angle and spacing are considered. All propellers were tested at the USAFA subsonic wind tunnel at an assumed UAV cruise velocity of 44 ft/s while measuring thrust, torque, sound pressure level, and rotational speed over a range of power settings. These propellers are modeled using the DoD HPCMP CREATETM-AV Kestrel simulation tools. The thrust and torque were extracted from these simulations and compared with experimental data. Pressure tap points were defined one inch behind the propeller. The instantaneous pressure data were measured at these locations for 20 spinning cycles. Sound pressure level values were then estimated from these data. Predictions are then compared with experimental data measured from a traversing microphone.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The measured sound field is decomposed into spherical harmonics, which enables the evaluation of the radiation pattern to non-probed positions. Additionally, the measurement setup allows the assessment of noise emission and psychoacoustic metrics at a wide range of angles. The obtained directivity patterns using a third-order spherical harmonic decomposition (SHD) are shown to exhibit low distortion with respect to the original measurements, therefore, validating the SHD as an adequate representation strategy. Furthermore, the noise emissions are evaluated, and the highest noise emission is observed in the 90 & DEG; azimuth direction. The exterior spherical acoustic holography description is employed to evaluate psychoacoustic metrics at arbitrary far-field positions and validated on a reference microphone. The estimated psychoacoustic metrics are closely related to the target metrics, which allows for sound quality analysis at any point external to the drone. (C) 2022 Acoustical Society of America.},

	abstract={This study investigated the small drone propeller noise, particularly the discrete blade passing frequency (BPF) tone and its harmonics at low frequencies less than 1000 Hz. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations were solved to investigate the steady and unsteady loading noise sources around the blades with a radius of 17 cm rotating at 5000 rpm (a blade tip Mach number is 0.264). The uRANS computations showed eccentric ellipsoidal isobaric surfaces on the upper and lower blade surfaces identified as a steady loading noise source of the drone propeller. A simple mathematical model of an ellipsoidal steady loading noise with the lattice Boltzmann method predicted the BPF tone and even-number harmonics comparable to NASA's SPL measurement of two different APC 1147 SF and DJI 9443 CF drone propellers. The decaying rate of -6 in the SPL spectrum was quite closely matched for the first two discrete tones. The transient pressure fluctuation characteristics on the upper surface of the rotating blades revealed that the unsteady loading noise by blade-vortex interactions is found most closely related to the third and sixth harmonics of the round per second noise. An unexpected fifth component also arose in some other rotational speeds because of the random nature of the phase difference of pressure fluctuations, even at the same positions of the two propeller blades.},

Thereafter, an improved weight is designed to further enhance the localization accuracy, and it can obtain the asymptotically optimal performance under the general Gaussian noise model, which is proved theoretically.

	abstract={Purpose of ReviewThis review aims to evaluate and discuss the current advances in the measurement and assessment of the noise generated by unconventional aircraft, such as unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles. Building upon the findings of this review, research gaps are identified, and further work is proposed to enhance existing and emerging methods for the appropriate noise management of these advanced air mobility (AAM) technologies.Recent FindingsNoise has been highlighted as one of the key concerns for the wider deployment of UAS and UAM operations. This is suggested to be due to having acoustic signatures with sound characteristics commonly associated with noise annoyance, such as 'sharpness' (the perceived proportion of high-pitched sonic energy) and 'tonality' (the perceptual prominence of concentrated sonic energy at discrete frequencies). These types of 'psychoacoustic features' are thought to be connected with observations of increased noise annoyance for AAM, compared with conventional aircraft and road vehicles, at the same level of sound exposure.SummaryIn the last few years, there has been a growing body of research on UAS and UAM noise. Research has focused on a comprehensive understanding of the sound sources of these unconventional aircraft under a wide range of operating and operational conditions. Based on gathered evidence, measurement protocols for both laboratory and field studies are very advanced for the acoustic characterisation of UAS in terms of sound level, frequency and directivity. Looking at the human response to UAS and UAM noise, loudness has been consistently reported as the main contributor to noise annoyance, with second-order contributions from other psychoacoustic features, such as sharpness, tonality and 'amplitude modulation' (fluctuations in loudness over time), varying among studies. Noise targets for UAS certification have been derived from existing regulations for conventional aircraft and rotorcraft, but might not account for the usually reported annoyance offset between UAS/UAM and conventional vehicles. Key research gaps identified include the lack of studies focusing on multiple events, and deeper understanding of the influence that personal or contextual factors may have on responses, which will be important for the development of robust methods for the assessment and minimisation of community noise annoyance due to the operation of these unconventional aircraft.},

Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to predict the periodic unsteady loading on the blades of three sets of rotors with different amounts of skew. This loading data is used to predict the acoustic pressure time-history and the sound pressure levels of the interaction tones radiated from the rotor systems. The predictions are compared with experimental measurements and show good agreement. It is observed that the amplitude of prominent interaction tones decreases as the blade skew angle increases and that the overall A-weighted sound power level of the interaction tones radiated from the rotor systems decreases significantly as skew angle increases. It is shown that this reduction in noise level is in-part caused by the dephasing of the acoustic pressure emitted from different radii along the blades of the rotor systems.},

	abstract={The use of small unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) for ecological studies and wildlife population assessments is increasing. These methods can provide significant benefits in terms of costs and reductions in human risk, but little is known if UAS-based approaches cause disturbance of animals during operations. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of UAS flights at gray seal breeding colonies on Hay and Saddle Islands in Nova Scotia, Canada. Using a small fixed-wing UAS, we assessed both immediate and short-term effects of surveys using sequential image analysis and between-flight seal counts in ten, 50 m(2) random quadrats at each colony. Counts of adult gray seals and young-of-the-year animals between first and second flights revealed no changes in abundance in quadrats (matched pair t-test p > 0.69) and slopes approaching 1 for linear regression comparisons (r(2) > 0.80). Sequential image analysis revealed no changes in orientation or posture of imaged animals. We also assessed the acoustic properties of the small UAS in relation to low ambient noise conditions using sound equivalent level (Leq) measurements with a calibrated U-MIK 1 and a 1/3 octave band soundscape approach. The results of Leq measurements indicate that small fixed-wing UAS are quiet, with most energy above 160 Hz, and that levels across 1/3 octave bands do not greatly exceed ambient acoustic measurements in a quiet field during operations at standard survey altitudes. As such, this platform is unlikely to acoustically disturb gray seals at breeding colonies during population surveys. The results of the present study indicate that the effects of small fixed-wing UAS on gray seals at breeding colonies are negligible, and that fixed-wing UAS-based approaches should be considered amongst best practices for assessing gray seal colonies.},

Two examples of studying noise impact on building and realistic urban environment are conducted. The effects of the surface acoustic impedance, source type and flight path are investigated. By using the efficient simulation solver, the noise impact can be quickly assessed through virtual flights, providing a promising approach to assist the low-noise flight planning and noise certification.

	abstract={Multi-rotor powered drones and urban mobility vehicles (UMV) have received considerable attention over recent years and attracted ever-increasing interest in their aerodynamic noise. Physics-based prediction tools for aerodynamic noise are of importance to facilitate quiet drone designs. In this work, a boundary element method (BEM) based solver is employed to evaluate the scattering of the rotor noise of a flying drone fuselage. The possible non-uniqueness of the solution is tackled using a Combined Helmholtz Interior integral Equation Formulation (CHIEF). The proposed method is applied to evaluate the noise scattering by a realistic fuselage configuration. Results suggest that the fuselage can visibly redirect propeller noise radiation at low frequencies because of wave diffractions. The fuselage can also affect the sound field by wave reflections at high frequencies, producing an apparent noise reduction.},

	abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, bringing great convenience to our lives and playing a pivotal role in future wireless networks and the Internet of things. One of the major problems associated with the UAV is the heterogeneous nature of such deployments; this heterogeneity poses many challenges, particularly in the areas of security and privacy. The key to solving these problems is to accurately identify and authenticate drones. In this article, a reliable UAV identify framework based on radio frequency fingerprint is proposed. First, we established a wireless signal label architecture and systematically collected, analyzed, and recorded the radio frequency signals of different UAVs in different flight modes and different distances in the telemetry link, and established UAV signal datasets. Then, the intelligent algorithm and anti-UAV system are designed by using the collected dataset, and the feasibility of the developed dataset for detecting and identifying UAVs is verified by using machine learning and deep learning. The simulation results show that under the condition of Gaussian white noise, the method based on deep learning achieves high reliability, and when the SNR is not less than 5dB, the model achieves more than 95% of the monitoring and recognition accuracy. Finally, we discussed the possible applications of the dataset in the future.},

	abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in recent years, are developing rapidly. However, when fly into private residences or public areas without authorizations, UAVs pose latent threats to personal privacy and public security. UAVs localization is a significant part of an anti-UAV system. In this paper, a remolded acoustic energy decay model preserved relative in acoustic energy attenuation inverse of distance square is used to generate training data. Multilayer perceptron(MLP) is the model to train these data and predicts accurate relative 3D space coordinates. Four different UAV flight trajectories are simulated. We also test robustness against noise with different levels. Simulation experiment results show that the deviation is less than 1.48 m in specific distances and noise levels, even with higher noise levels the deviation can still be accepted. The problem of limited detection range is overcome by the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with more sensors. Long and short-term memory (LSTM) is investigated, but it doesn&#39;t outperform MLP in accuracy and processing time.},

	abstract={The number of applications for drones under R&D have growth significantly during the last few years; however, the wider adoption of these technologies requires ensuring public trust and acceptance. Noise has been identified as one of the key concerns for public acceptance. Although substantial research has been carried out to better understand the sound source generation mechanisms in drones, important questions remain about the requirements for operational procedures and regulatory frameworks. An important issue is that drones operate within different airspace, closer to communities than conventional aircraft, and that the noise produced is highly tonal and contains a greater proportion of high-frequency broadband noise compared with typical aircraft noise. This is likely to cause concern for exposed communities due to impacts on public health and well-being. This paper presents a modelling framework for setting recommendations for drone operations to minimise community noise impact. The modelling framework is based on specific noise targets, e.g., the guidelines at a receiver position defined by WHO for sleep quality inside a residential property. The main assumption is that the estimation of drone noise exposure indoors is highly relevant for informing operational constraints to minimise noise annoyance and sleep disturbance. This paper illustrates the applicability of the modelling framework with a case study, where maximum A-weighted sound pressure levels LAmax and sound exposure levels SEL as received in typical indoor environments are used to define drone-facade minimum distance to meet WHO recommendations. The practical and scalable capabilities of this modelling framework make it a useful tool for inferring and assessing the impact of drone noise through compliance with appropriate guideline noise criteria. It is considered that with further refinement, this modelling framework could prove to be a significant tool in assisting with the development of noise metrics, regulations specific to drone operations and the assessment of future drone operations and associated noise.},

The tonal and broadband noise components are considered using analytical and semi-analytical prediction methods. The noise propagation in the urban environment is computed using an efficient Gaussian beam tracing method. The influence of flight speeds, payloads and ground vegetation on noise reception at different observation locations are investigated. The instantaneous sound level can be higher if the drone is operated at a relatively higher speed. However, the overall sound exposure might be lower because of the shorter flight time. Similarly, the drone with a heavier payload could be louder, but in the meanwhile, fewer flight times are required. The platform provides an economical approach to understanding the effect of those competing influential factors, which are essential for the following low-noise flight path planning.},

Numerical simulations of a flexible UAV propeller are conducted under hovering conditions to investigate the coupling effect on noise prediction using a fluid-structure interaction and acoustic model based on Formulation 1A of Farassat. The bending-torsion coupling leads to additional bending-induced torsional deformation along with considerable increases in noise and the overall sound pressure level. The results indicate that the noise evaluated without the coupling was underestimated compared to that evaluated with the coupling. Finally, the bending-torsion coupling is shown to be essential for precisely predicting the noise of a rotating flexible UAV propeller to respond to strengthening noise regulations.},

	abstract={Multi-rotor drones equipped with acoustic sensors have great potential for bioacoustically monitoring vocal species in the environment for biodiversity conservation. The bottleneck of this emerging technology is the ego-noise from the rotating motors and propellers, which can completely mask the target sound and make sound recordings unusable for further analysis. The ego-noise not only degrades the performance of bioacoustic monitoring but also impacts the behaviour of target species if the drone is too close to the target area. In this paper, we address this challenging problem by combining hardware and software solutions that minimize the impact of drone ego-noise on bioacoustic monitoring.To collect the target sound from the ground, we used a shotgun microphone recording system suspended underneath the drone body with a wire rope (steel fishing line) of length 2 m. The suspended rope puts a large distance between the drone and the recorder, reducing the propeller sound perceived by the microphone. The shotgun microphone enables the sound to be picked up from the ground effectively while rejecting the drone sound from above. We further developed a software solution that aims to automatically recognize the bird species from the bird call recording and we proposed a noise-augmented training scheme to improve the robustness of bird recognition in the presence of strong drone noise.We evaluated the performance of the system in a test problem of recognizing 20 bird species with in-flight recordings, where a loudspeaker on the ground simulates bird calls. The recordings were obtained using a drone hovering at various altitudes ranging from 5 to 30 m. By combining the hardware and software solutions, the system recognizes birds robustly at an altitude of 30 m and signal-to-noise ratio -25 dB.This demonstrates the feasibility of our drone audition system for bioacoustic monitoring. The proposed method overcomes a long-standing bottleneck problem in drone audition and promises new applications of bioacoustic monitoring in research and management.},

Taking into account the drone crash, noise, on-board camera, and ground environment factors, a UAV urban logistics risk index evaluation model was constructed. First, the UAV image regression model was used to construct a three-dimensional grid, and then a comprehensive third-party risk index model of UAV urban logistics was built based on the casualty and noise risks. Finally, the Southern District of Civil Aviation University of China was selected as an example scene, and surface data were obtained through a field investigation and instrument measurements. Then, the risk of drone operations in the airspace 30-60 m above this area was evaluated. The results showed that the third-party risk was lower when the UAV flying altitude above a building was greater. However, in other areas such as lakes, woods, roads, open spaces, a lower flight altitude had a lower risk. A comparison of the whole airspace showed that the third-party risk was the lowest when the drone operated at an altitude of 30 m. The results also showed that the third-party risk above the lake and greenery was the lowest when on the same plane, followed by the lower risk above the buildings and open squares, with the highest third-party risk above the canteen passage.},

With the development of battery technologies, communication, navigation, surveillance, and autonomous systems in general, many UAVs are expected to operate at relatively low altitudes. Thus, the problem of UAV noise impact on human health and well-being will be more pronounced. In this paper, we conducted noise measurements of two UAVs of different performance (quadrotor and hexarotor) in flying up and down, hovering, and overflight procedures. Respondents of good hearing who were confirmed by audiogram measurement and had participated in the survey during UAV noise measurement gave their subjective assessments on the UAV noise perception. UAV noise measurements and subjective respondents' assessments were analysed and related. UAV noise analysis showed that the parameters measured at the same measurement point for the hexarotor were higher than those for the quadrotor in flying up and down and flying-over procedures. Low frequency noise was present in the noise spectrum of both drones. Participants were able to distinguish between the noise of UAVs and had a generally more negative experience with the hexarotor. Regardless of the noise perception, more than 80% of the respondents believe there are more pros than cons for UAV introduction into everyday life.},

In this paper, we study the performance of a wireless network in which a UAV is employed as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay linking a ground base station (BS) with multiple users in area where direct terrestrial path between the ground BS and the users is assumed to be blocked. The channel between the BS and the UAV is assumed to follow Rician channel model, while the links between the UAV and the end users are assumed to follow Rayleigh fading model with opportunistic scheduling scheme for user selection. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average symbol error rate (ASER) are derived. Due to complexity of the derived closed-form expressions and in order to get more insights at the system behavior in terms of system coding gain and diversity order, an asymptotic expression is derived for the outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. Furthermore, an optimization of the UAV 3D location that minimizes the asymptotic outage probability is achieved. Our numerical results show that increasing the UAV transmit power much more than the ground BS transmit power does not improve the system performance. The increase in the UAV transmit power is positive only if the ground BS transmit power is higher than the UAV transmit power. We also show that the increase of the Rician -factor leads to improving the system performance when the ground BS transmit power is less than or close to the UAV transmit power. Furthermore, the proposed optimization scheme shows superior performance gain in minimizing the outage probability compared to the conventional scenarios, where the UAV is located at a fixed altitude over the center of the coverage region.},

	abstract={This paper investigates the interaction tones produced by the periodic unsteady loading on the blades of two different contra-rotating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) rotor systems using computational, analytical, and experimental methods. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to predict the unsteady loading on the rotor blades and to visualize the flow through the rotors. Semi-analytical models are also presented for predicting the portion of this unsteady loading due to the interaction of each blade with the bound potential field of the adjacent rotor. A comparison of the unsteady loading predicted using the CFD simulations and the semi-analytical models shows that, for the cases considered, the semi-analytical models accurately predict the unsteady loading on the top rotor and that the bound potential field interaction source is a significant contributor to the total unsteady loading on the bottom rotor. A frequency-domain acoustic analogy method is also presented, which is used to calculate the interaction tones produced by the unsteady loading on the rotor blades at various observer locations. Predictions of the sound pressure levels of the prominent interaction tones at different observer locations are presented and compared with experimental measurements showing generally good agreement. The effect of rotor spacing on the amplitude of the interaction tones is also explored, and it is shown that the methods predict a decrease in sound pressure level produced by increasing the rotor spacing and that these predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements.},

We propose a multiple satellite joint target detection method based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This detection algorithm is robust to the reference channel noise. According to the known or unknown noise variance and interference targets, the conditions are divided into three types, where we use GLRT to design the detectors under different conditions.

For verification of the suggested method, two experiments were performed for a single isolated rotor and a full vehicle. The measured spectra of the isolated rotor were used for verifying the spectrum before the correction. Also, the spectra corrected by the RPM fluctuation correction method were compared and verified with the noise of the full vehicle, which has frequency modulation effects.},

	abstract={This paper addresses one of the recognized barriers to the unrestricted adoption of Unmanned Aircraft (UA) in mainstream urban use-noise-and reviews existing approaches for estimating and mitigating this problem. The aircraft noise problem is discussed upfront in general terms by introducing the sound emission, propagation, and psychoacoustic effects. The propagation of sound in the atmosphere, which is the focus of this paper, is then analysed in detail to isolate the environmental and operational factors that predominantly influence the perceived noise on the ground, especially looking at large-scale low-altitude UA operations, such as in the envisioned Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts. The physics of sound propagation are presented, considering all attenuation effects and the anomalies due to Doppler and atmospheric effects, such as wind, thermal inversion, and turbulence. The analysis allows to highlight the limitations of current mainstream aircraft noise modelling and certification approaches and, in particular, their inadequacy in addressing the noise of UA and, more generally, UAM vehicles. This finding is important considering that, although reducing noise at the source has remained a priority for manufacturers to enable the scaling up of UAM and drone delivery operations in the near future, the impact of poorly considered propagation and psychoacoustic effects on the actual perceived noise on the ground is equally important for the same objective. For instance, optimizing the flight paths as a function of local weather conditions can significantly contribute to minimizing the impact of noise on communities, thus paving the way for the introduction of full-scale UAM operations. A more reliable and accurate modelling of noise ground signatures for both manned and unmanned low-flying aircraft will aid in identifying the real-time data stream requirements from distributed sensors on the ground. New developments in surrogate sound propagation models, more pervasive real-time sensor data, and suitable computing resources are expected to both yield more reliable and effective estimates of noise reaching the ground listeners and support a dynamic planning of flight paths.},

We assessed the effects of a UAV on the behavior of southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) in Australia. Focal follows of ten right whale mother-calf pairs were conducted using a theodolite. Control data were recorded for 30 min, and then a DJI Inspire 1 Pro was flown above the whales for 10 min at 5 m altitude. Potential changes to horizontal behavior (swim speed and turning angle) and surfacing pattern (interbreath intervals) were investigated by comparing mother-calf behavior before and during UAV approaches. Changes in respiration rate were used to quantify energetic effects. We also explored acoustic cue perceptibility of the UAV at 5, 10, and 30 m altitude, by measuring the received UAV underwater noise level on whales equipped with acoustic tags (DTAGs). The received noise levels were 86.0 +/- 3.9 dB re 1 mu Pa, while the measured ambient noise was 80.7 +/- 7.3 dB re 1 mu Pa in the same frequency band (100-1,500 Hz). No behavioral response to the UAV was observed. This provides support for UAVs as a noninvasive tool to study baleen whale behavior and ecophysiology.},

	abstract={Despite the rapid increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in marine mammal research, knowledge of the effects of UAVs on study animals is very limited. We recorded the in-air and in-water noise from two commonly used multi-rotor UAVs, the SwellPro Splashdrone and the DJI Inspire 1 Pro, to assess the potential for negative noise effects of UAV use. The Splashdrone and Inspire UAVs produced broad-band in-air source levels of 80 dB re 20 mu Pa and 81 dB re 20 mu Pa (rms), with fundamental frequencies centered at 60 Hz and 150 Hz. The noise of the UAVs coupled poorly into the water, and could only be quantified above background noise of the recording sites at 1 m depth when flying at altitudes of 5 and 10 m, resulting in broad-band received levels around 95 dB re mu Pa rms for the Splashdrone and around 101 dB re mu Pa rms for the Inspire. The third octave levels of the underwater UAV noise profiles are (i) close to ambient noise levels in many shallow water habitats, (ii) largely below the hearing thresholds at low frequencies of toothed whales, but (iii) likely above the hearing thresholds of baleen whales and pinnipeds. So while UAV noise may be heard by some marine mammals underwater, it is implied that the underwater noise effect is small, even for animals close to the water surface. Our findings will be valuable for wildlife managers and regulators when issuing permits and setting guidelines for UAV operations. Further, our experimental setup can be used by others to evaluate noise effects of larger sized UAVs on marine mammals.},

	abstract={This paper presents the results of a study evaluating the human perception of the noise produced by four different small quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This study utilised measurements and recordings of the noise produced by the quadcopter UAVs in hover and in constant-speed flight at a fixed altitude. Measurements made using a 1/2 '' microphone were used to calculate a range of different noise metrics for each noise event. Noise recordings were also made using a spherical microphone array (an Eigenmike system). The recordings were reproduced using a 3D sound reproduction system installed in a large anechoic chamber located at The University of Auckland. Thirty-seven participants were subjected to the recordings and asked to rate their levels of annoyance in response to the noise, and asked to perform a simple cognitive task in order to assess the level of distraction caused by the noise. This study discusses the noise levels measured during the test and how the various noise metrics relate to the annoyance ratings. It was found that annoyance strongly correlates with the sound pressure level and loudness metrics, and that there is a very strong correlation between the annoyance caused by a UAV in hover and in flyby at the same height. While some significant differences between the distraction caused by the UAV noise for different cases were observed in the cognitive distraction test, the results were inconclusive. This was likely due to a ceiling effect observed in the participants' test scores.},

	abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are being utilized by wildlife biologists to monitor populations of birds and mammals. However, the reaction of wildlife to drones varies by species, so a preliminary evaluation must be conducted to determine if the target species can be detected via drone footage and to determine how the target species will react to drone presence. Lek-mating prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus spp.) seem amenable to drone-based surveys because they are relatively large and display in groups on elevated sites with sparse vegetation. The goal of our study was to determine what flight characteristics maximize prairie-chicken detection on drone video footage, to document the birds' reactions to the drones, and to compare how the noise produced by the drones compares to ambient sounds. We tested 3 sizes of rotary-winged drones, flown at 3 heights, with 3 different camera angles by flying over known prairie-chicken leks. We determined that >65% of prairie-chickens present were detected using video footage at a height of 100 m with a 10 degrees camera angle. Drones of different sizes had similar detectability. However, observers in blinds adjacent to leks routinely detected more birds than were detected on drone footage (detection on drone footage was 39.7 +/- 9.6% of birds present). Prairie-chickens flushed in 96% of trials when a drone was flown over display locations. Time to return to the lek following drone disturbance was similar to prairie-chickens' reactions to natural predators. Prairie-chickens flushed when drone sound levels were comparable to ambient noise. Developing guidelines for the ethical use of drones in wildlife research will require quantifying the amount of taxa-specific disturbance caused by drones. Our study begins to close this knowledge gap by documenting disturbance to upland, lek-mating grouse of conservation concern, and suggests that the focal species' reaction to aerial predators may provide clues as to how that species may react to drones.},

	abstract={A noise covariance matrix (NCM) estimation method for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) audition is proposed with rotor noise reduction as its primary focus. The proposed NCM estimation method could be incorporated into audio processing algorithms using UAV-mounted microphone array systems. The NCM is formed through accurate estimation of the microphone array input signal's amplitude and phase by using a multi-sensory rotor noise power spectral density (PSD) estimator and a filter formed by exploiting the acoustical relationship between the microphone array and the rotor noise sources, respectively. The estimated NCM aims to be readily incorporable into several source enhancement algorithms to reduce the effects of rotor noise and improve the resultant audio quality. Experiment evaluation using real in-flight UAV rotor noise recordings shows that the estimated NCM significantly improves rotor noise reduction (of up to $\sim 28$ dB) and the quality of the target sound.},

	abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed and studied for various applications, including drone deliveries, broadcasting, scouting, crop dusting, and firefighting. To enable the wide use of UAVs, their exact aeroacoustic characteristics must be assessed. In this study, a noise prediction method for a,ducted fan UAV with complicated geometry was developed. In general, calculation efficiency is increased by simulating a ducted fan UAV without the struts that fix the fuselage to the ducts. However, numerical predictions of noise and aerodynamics differ according to whether struts are present. In terms of aerodynamic performance, the total thrust with and without struts is similar owing to the tendency of the thrust of a'blade to offset the drag of the struts. However, in aeroacoustic simulations, the strut effect should be considered in order to predict the UAV's noise because noise from the blades can be changed by the strut effect. Modelling of the strut effect revealed that the dominant tonal noises were closely correlated with the blade passage frequency of the experimental results. Based on the successful detection of noise sources from a ducted fan UAV system, using the proposed noise contribution contour, methods for noise reduction can be suggested by comparing numerical results with measured noise profiles.},
